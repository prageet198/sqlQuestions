Question:-
You are provided with election data from multiple districts in India. Each district conducted elections for selecting a representative from various political parties. 
Your task is to analyze the election results to determine the winning party at national levels.  Here are the steps to identify winner:

1- Determine the winning party in each district based on the candidate with the highest number of votes.
2- If multiple candidates from different parties have the same highest number of votes in a district
  , consider it a tie, and all tied candidates are declared winners for that district.
3- Calculate the total number of seats won by each party across all districts
4- A party wins the election if it secures more than 50% of the total seats available nationwide.
Display the total number of seats won by each party and a result column specifying Winner or Loser. Order the output by total seats won in descending order.

Table: elections
+---------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE   |
+---------------+-------------+
| district_name | varchar(20) |
| candidate_id  | int         |
| party_name    | varchar(10) |
| votes         | int         |
+---------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH calculation AS (
select district_name,candidate_id,party_name,votes,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY district_name ORDER BY votes DESC) AS ranked
from elections
  ),
  overAllSeats AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT district_name) AS totalSeatNationalWise
    FROM elections),
combineData AS (
SELECT party_name, COUNT(*) AS totalWin, 
totalSeatNationalWise
  FROM calculation CROSS JOIN overAllSeats
  WHERE ranked='1'
  GROUP BY party_name, totalSeatNationalWise
  ORDER BY totalWin DESC
  )
  SELECT party_name, totalWin,
  CASE WHEN ((totalWin/totalSeatNationalWise)*100)>50 THEN 'Winner'
  ELSE 'Loser' END AS result
  FROM combineData

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (
select * 
, rank() over(partition by district_name order by votes desc) as rn
from elections
)
, cte_total_seats as (
select count(distinct district_name) as total_seats from elections
)
select party_name, count(*) as seats_won
, case when count(*)>total_seats*0.5 then 'Winner' else 'Loser' end as result
from cte , cte_total_seats
where rn=1
group by party_name,total_seats
order by seats_won desc;

Question:-
In the Netflix dataset containing information about viewers and their viewing history, devise a query to identify viewers who primarily use mobile devices for viewing, 
but occasionally switch to other devices. Specifically, find viewers who have watched at least 75% of their total viewing time on mobile devices 
but have also used at least one other devices such as tablets or smart TVs for viewing. Provide the user ID and the percentage of viewing time spent on mobile devices. 
Round the result to nearest integer.

Table: viewing_history
+-------------+--------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE    |
+-------------+--------------+
| user_id     | int          |
| title       | varchar(20)  |
| device_type | varchar(10)  |
| watch_mins  | int          |
+-------------+--------------+

My Solution:-
WITH totalViews AS (
  select user_id, SUM(watch_mins) AS totalViews
  from viewing_history
  GROUP BY user_id
  ),
  mobileView AS (
    SELECT user_id, SUM(watch_mins) AS totalMobileViews
    FROM viewing_history 
    WHERE device_type='Mobile'
    GROUP BY user_id
    ),
    otherView AS (
      SELECT user_id, SUM(watch_mins) AS totalOtherViews
      FROM viewing_history
      WHERE device_type!='Mobile'
      GROUP BY user_id
      )
      SELECT totalViews.user_id,
      ROUND((totalMobileViews/totalViews)*100,0) AS mobilePercView
      FROM totalViews INNER JOIN mobileView ON totalViews.user_id=mobileView.user_id
      INNER JOIN otherView ON otherView.user_id=mobileView.user_id
      WHERE ROUND((totalMobileViews/totalViews)*100,2)>=75

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (
select user_id, count(distinct device_type) as cnt_device
, sum(case when device_type='Mobile' then watch_mins end) as mobile_watch_mins
,sum(watch_mins) as total_watch_mins
from viewing_history 
group by user_id
)
select user_id,ROUND( mobile_watch_mins*100.0/total_watch_mins ,0 ) as mobile_percentage_view
 from cte 
where cnt_device >=2 
and (mobile_watch_mins*1.0/total_watch_mins) > 0.75;

Question:-
You are given three tables: students, friends and packages. Friends table has student id and friend id(only best friend). A student can have more than one best friends. 
Write a query to output the names of those students whose ALL friends got offered a higher salary than them. Display those students name and difference 
between their salary and average of their friends salaries.

Table: students 
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
+-------------+----------+
Table: friends 
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| friend_id   | int      |
+-------------+----------+
Table: packages 
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
SELECT friends.id AS studentId, friends.friend_id, studentPackage.salary AS studentSalary, friendsPackage.salary AS friendsSalary,
COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY friends.id) AS totalFriends,
CASE WHEN studentPackage.salary<friendsPackage.salary THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS flag
from friends INNER JOIN packages as studentPackage ON friends.id=studentPackage.id
INNER JOIN packages AS friendsPackage ON friends.friend_id=friendsPackage.id
ORDER BY friends.id
)
SELECT students.name, (studentSalary-AVG(friendsSalary)) AS salaryDiff
FROM initialData INNER JOIN students ON initialData.studentId=students.id
GROUP BY students.name, totalFriends,studentSalary
HAVING totalFriends=SUM(flag)

Actual Solution:-
select s.name, sp.salary-avg(fp.salary) as salary_diff
from students s
inner join friends f on s.id=f.id
inner join packages sp on s.id=sp.id 
inner join packages fp on f.friend_id=fp.id 
group by s.name , sp.salary 
having sp.salary < min(fp.salary) 
order by s.name;

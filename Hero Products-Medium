DIFFICULTY:-Medium
COMPANY:-Flipkart

Question:-
Flipkart an ecommerce company wants to find out its top most selling product by quantity in each category. In case of a tie when quantities sold are same 
for more than 1 product, then we need to give preference to the product with higher sales value.
Display category and product in output with category in ascending order.

Table: orders
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| category    | varchar(10) |
| order_id    | int         |
| product_id  | varchar(20) |
| quantity    | int         |
| unit_price  | int         |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH furnitureData AS (
select  product_id,
category,
SUM(unit_price * quantity) AS totalSalePrice,
SUM(quantity) AS totalQuantity
from orders
GROUP BY category,product_id
),
ranking AS (
SELECT category,
product_id,
totalQuantity,
totalSalePrice,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY totalQuantity DESC, totalSalePrice DESC) AS ranked
FROM furnitureData
 )
 SELECT category, product_id FROM ranking
 WHERE ranked='1'
 ORDER BY category

Actual Solution:-
with sales as (
select category,product_id,sum(quantity) as quantity_sold, sum(unit_price*quantity) total_sales
 from orders
 group by category,product_id
)
select category,product_id 
from (
select *
 , row_number() over(partition by category order by quantity_sold desc,total_sales desc) as rn 
 from sales 
 ) s
where rn=1
ORDER BY category ASC;

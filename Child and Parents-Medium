Question:-
You are tasked to determine the mother and father's name for each child based on the given data. The people table provides information about individuals, 
including their names and genders. The relations table specifies parent-child relationships, linking each child (c_id) to their parent (p_id). 
Each parent is identified by their ID, and their gender is used to distinguish between mothers (F) and fathers (M).

Write an SQL query to retrieve the names of each child along with the names of their respective mother and father, if available. If a child has only one parent 
listed in the relations table, the query should still include that parent's name and leave the other parent's name as NULL. Order the output by child name in ascending order.

Tables: people
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| gender      | char(2)     |
| id          | int         |
| name        | varchar(20) |
+-------------+-------------+
Tables: relations 
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| c_id        | int       |
| p_id        | int       |
+-------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH motherDetail AS (
  SELECT relations.c_id,people.name AS motherName
  FROM relations INNER JOIN people ON relations.p_id=people.id AND people.gender='F'
  ),
  fatherDetail AS(
    SELECT relations.c_id,people.name AS fatherName
  FROM relations INNER JOIN people ON relations.p_id=people.id AND people.gender='M'
    )
    SELECT people.name AS childName, motherName,fatherName
    FROM relations INNER JOIN people ON relations.c_id=people.id
    LEFT JOIN motherDetail ON motherDetail.c_id=relations.c_id
    LEFT JOIN fatherDetail ON fatherDetail.c_id=relations.c_id
    GROUP BY people.name, motherName, fatherName
    ORDER BY people.name

Actual Solution:-
WITH mother_father AS (
    SELECT r.c_id AS child_id,
           max(p1.name) AS mother_name,
           max(p2.name) AS father_name
    FROM relations r
    LEFT JOIN people p1 ON r.p_id = p1.id AND p1.gender = 'F' -- Join with people table to get mother's name
    LEFT JOIN people p2 ON r.p_id = p2.id AND p2.gender = 'M' -- Join with people table to get father's name
    group by r.c_id
)
SELECT p.name AS child_name,
       mf.mother_name,
       mf.father_name
FROM people p
INNER JOIN mother_father mf ON p.id = mf.child_id
order by child_name;

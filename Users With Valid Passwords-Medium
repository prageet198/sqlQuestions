Question:-
Write a SQL query to identify the users with valid passwords according to the conditions below.

The password must be at least 8 characters long.
The password must contain at least one letter (lowercase or uppercase).
The password must contain at least one digit (0-9).
The password must contain at least one special character from the set @#$%^&*.

Table: user_passwords 
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| user_id     | int         |    
| user_name   | varchar(10) |
| password    | varchar(20) |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
SELECT user_id, user_name
FROM user_passwords
WHERE 
LENGTH(Password) >= 8 AND  -- At least 8 characters long
    Password REGEXP '[A-Za-z]' AND  -- Contains at least one letter
    Password REGEXP '[0-9]' AND  -- Contains at least one digit
    Password REGEXP '[@#$%^&*]' AND  -- Contains at least one special character
    Password NOT LIKE '% %';  -- Does not contain spaces

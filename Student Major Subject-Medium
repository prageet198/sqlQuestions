Question:-
You are provided with information about students enrolled in various courses at a university. Each student can be enrolled in multiple courses, 
and for each course, it is specified whether the course is a major or an elective for the student.
Write a SQL query to generate a report that lists the primary (major_flag='Y') course for each student. If a student is enrolled in only one course, 
that course should be considered their primary course by default irrespective of the flag. Sort the output by student_id.

Table: student_courses
+-------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE  |
+-------------+------------+
| student_id  | int        |
| course_id   | int        |
| major_flag  | varchar(1) |
+-------------+------------+

My Solution:-
WITH onlyOneCourse AS (
select student_id, MIN(course_id) AS course_id
from student_courses
GROUP BY student_id
HAVING COUNT(*)=1
  ),
  multipleCourse AS (
    select student_id, course_id
from student_courses
WHERE major_flag='Y'
 )
 SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM onlyOneCourse
 UNION ALL
 SELECT * FROM multipleCourse) AS A
 GROUP BY student_id,course_id
 ORDER BY student_id

Actual Solution:-
SELECT student_id, course_id
FROM student_courses
WHERE major_flag = 'Y'
   OR student_id IN (
       SELECT student_id 
       FROM student_courses 
       GROUP BY student_id 
       HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
   );

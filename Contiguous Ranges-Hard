Question:-
Write an SQL query to find all the contiguous ranges of log_id values.

Table: logs
+-------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE  |
+-------------+------------+
| log_id      | int        |
+-------------+------------+

My Solution:-
WITH logging AS(
  
select log_id, log_id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY log_id) AS groupId
from logs
)
SELECT MIN(log_id) AS startingNum, MAX(log_id) AS endingNum
FROM logging
GROUP BY groupId

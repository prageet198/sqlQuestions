Question:-
Given a list of matches in the group stage of the football World Cup, compute the number of points each team currently has.
You are given two tables, "teams" and "matches", with the following structures:

Table: teams
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| team_id     | int      |
| team_name   | VARCHAR  | 
+-------------+----------+
Table: matches
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| match_id    | int      |
| host_team   | int      | 
| guest_team  | int      | 
| host_goals  | int      | 
| guest_goals | int      | 
+-------------+----------+
 

You need to compute the total number of points each team has scored after all the matches described in the table. The scoring rules are as follows:

• If a team wins a match (scores more goals than the other team), it receives 3 points.
• If a team draws a match (scores exactly the same number of goals as the opponent), it receives 1 point.
• If a team loses a match (scores fewer goals than the opponent), it receives no points.

Write an SQL query that returns all the teams ids along with its name and the number of points it received after all described matches ("num_points"). 
The table should be ordered by "num_points" (in decreasing order). In case of a tie, order the rows by "team_id" (in increasing order).

My Solution:-
SELECT 
    t.team_id,
    t.team_name,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN m.host_team = t.team_id AND m.host_goals > m.guest_goals THEN 3
        WHEN m.guest_team = t.team_id AND m.guest_goals > m.host_goals THEN 3
        WHEN m.host_team = t.team_id AND m.host_goals = m.guest_goals THEN 1
        WHEN m.guest_team = t.team_id AND m.guest_goals = m.host_goals THEN 1
        ELSE 0
    END) AS num_points
FROM teams t
LEFT JOIN matches m ON m.host_team = t.team_id OR m.guest_team = t.team_id
GROUP BY t.team_id, t.team_name
ORDER BY num_points DESC, t.team_id ASC;

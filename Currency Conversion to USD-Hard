Question:-
You are given two tables, sales_amount and exchange_rate. The sales_amount table contains sales transactions in various currencies, 
and the exchange_rate table provides the exchange rates for converting different currencies into USD, along with the dates when these rates became effective.

Your task is to write an SQL query that converts all sales amounts into USD using the most recent applicable exchange rate that was effective on or 
before the sale date. Then, calculate the total sales in USD for each sale date.

Table: sales_amount  
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| sale_date   | int      |    
| sales_amount| int      |
| currency    | varchar  |
+-------------+----------+
Table: exchange_rate  
+-----------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME     | DATA_TYPE|
+---------------+------------+
| from_currency | varchar    |    
| to_currency   | varchar    |
| exchange_rate | decimal    |
| effective_date| date       |
+-------------+--------------+

My Solution:-
WITH exchangeData AS(
SELECT from_currency, exchange_rate, effective_date,
LEAD(effective_date,1,'9999-01-01') OVER(PARTITION BY from_currency ORDER BY effective_date) AS cutOffDate
from exchange_rate
),
finalData AS(
SELECT sale_date, (sales_amount * exchange_rate) AS salesInUsd
FROM sales_amount LEFT JOIN exchangeData ON sales_amount.currency=exchangeData.from_currency AND (sale_date>=effective_date AND sale_date<cutOffDate)
 )
 SELECT sale_date, SUM(salesInUsd) AS totalSalesInUsd
 FROM finalData
 GROUP BY sale_date
 ORDER BY sale_date

Actual Solution:-
SELECT 
    sa.sale_date,
    SUM(sa.sales_amount * er.exchange_rate) AS total_sales_in_usd
FROM 
    sales_amount sa
JOIN 
    exchange_rate er ON sa.currency = er.from_currency
AND 
    er.effective_date = (
        SELECT MAX(effective_date)
        FROM exchange_rate
        WHERE from_currency = sa.currency
        AND effective_date <= sa.sale_date
    )
GROUP BY 
    sa.sale_date
ORDER BY 
    sa.sale_date;

Question:-
You are provided with a table named Products containing information about various products, including their names and prices. 
Write a SQL query to count number of products in each category based on its price into three categories below. Display the output in descending order of no of products.

1- "Low Price" for products with a price less than 100
2- "Medium Price" for products with a price between 100 and 500 (inclusive)
3- "High Price" for products with a price greater than 500.
Tables: Products
+--------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE   |
+--------------+-------------+
| product_id   | int         |
| product_name | varchar(20) |
| price        | int         |
+--------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH productCategory AS (
SELECT product_id,
       price,
       CASE 
           WHEN price < 100 THEN 'Low Price'
           WHEN price >= 100 AND price <= 500 THEN 'Medium Price'
           ELSE 'High Price' 
       END AS category
FROM products
 )
 SELECT category, COUNT(product_id) AS no_of_product
 FROM productCategory
 GROUP BY category
 ORDER BY 2 DESC

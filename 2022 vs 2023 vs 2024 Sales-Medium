Question:-
You are tasked with analyzing the sales growth of products over the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. Your goal is to identify months where the sales for a 
product have consistently increased from 2022 to 2023 and from 2023 to 2024.
Your task is to write an SQL query to generate a report that includes the sales for each product at the month level for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. 
However, you should only include product and months combination where the sales have consistently increased from 2022 to 2023 and from 2023 to 2024, 
display the output in ascending order of product_id.
Table: orders
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| order_id    | int       |
| customer_id | int       |
| order_date  | date      |
| product_id  | int       |
| sales       | int       |
+-------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH overAllSales AS(
select product_id,
SUM(sales) AS totalSales,
YEAR(order_date) AS salesYear,
MONTH(order_date) AS salesMonth
from orders
GROUP BY product_id, MONTH(order_date), YEAR(order_date)
  ),
  monthlyYearlySales AS(
  SELECT product_id, salesMonth,
  SUM(CASE WHEN salesYear='2022' THEN totalSales ELSE 0 END) AS sales2022,
  SUM(CASE WHEN salesYear='2023' THEN totalSales ELSE 0 END) AS sales2023,
  SUM(CASE WHEN salesYear='2024' THEN totalSales ELSE 0 END) AS sales2024
  FROM overAllSales
     GROUP BY product_id,salesMonth
    )
    SELECT * FROM monthlyYearlySales
    WHERE sales2024>sales2023 AND sales2023>sales2022
    ORDER BY product_id

DIFFICULTY:-Medium
COMPANY:-Amazon

Question:-
Amazon is expanding their pharmacy business to new cities every year. You are given a table of business operations where you have information about cities 
where Amazon is doing operations along with the business date information.
Write a SQL to find year wise number of new cities added to the business, display the output in increasing order of year.

Table: business_operations
+---------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE |
+---------------+-----------+
| business_date | date      |
| city_id       | int       |
+---------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH baseTable AS(
select YEAR(business_date) AS businessYear,
city_id
from business_operations 
),
rankedCities AS (
  SELECT businessYear,
  city_id,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY city_id ORDER BY businessYear) AS firstOccurance
  FROM baseTable)
 SELECT businessYear,
 COUNT(DISTINCT city_id) AS noOfNewCities
 FROM rankedCities
 WHERE firstOccurance='1'
 GROUP BY businessYear
 ORDER BY businessYear

Acutual Solution:-
with cte as (
select city_id,min(YEAR(business_date)) as first_operation_year
 from business_operations 
 group by city_id
)
select first_operation_year,count(*) as no_of_new_cities
from cte
group by first_operation_year
ORDER BY first_operation_year ASC;

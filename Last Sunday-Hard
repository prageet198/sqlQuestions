Question:-
Write an SQL to get the date of the last Sunday as per today's date. If you are solving the problem on Sunday 
then it should still return the date of last Sunday (not current date).

Note : Dates are displayed as per UTC time zone.

My Solution:-
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL (WEEKDAY(CURRENT_DATE) + 1) DAY AS last_sunday;

Actual Solution:-
SELECT DATE_SUB(DATE(now()), INTERVAL case when DAYOFWEEK(now())=1 then 7 else DAYOFWEEK(now())-1 end DAY) as last_sunday;

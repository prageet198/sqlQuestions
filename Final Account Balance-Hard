Question:-
You are given history of your bank account for the year 2020. Each transaction is either a credit card payment or incoming transfer. 
There is a fee of holding a credit card which you have to pay every month, Fee is 5 per month. However, you are not charged for a given month 
if you made at least 2 credit card payments for a total cost of at least 100 within that month. Note that this fee is not included in the supplied history of transactions.
Each row in the table contains information about a single transaction. If the amount value is negative, it is a credit card payment otherwise it is an incoming transfer. 
At the beginning of the year, the balance of your account was 0 . Your task is to compute the balance at the end of the year. 

Table : Transactions 
+------------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME      | DATA_TYPE |
+------------------+-----------+
| amount           | int       |
| transaction_date | date      |
+------------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH RECURSIVE months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month_id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT month_id + 1
    FROM months
    WHERE month_id < 12
),
creditCardDetail AS(
SELECT MONTH(transaction_date) AS months, SUM(amount)*-1 AS totalAmt
FROM transactions
WHERE amount<0
GROUP BY MONTH(transaction_date)
),
transactionData AS(
SELECT MONTH(transaction_date) AS months, SUM(amount) AS totalAmt
FROM transactions
WHERE amount>0
GROUP BY MONTH(transaction_date)
),
overallData AS(
SELECT month_id, IFNULL(creditCardDetail.totalAmt,0) AS monthlyDebit, IFNULL(transactionData.totalAmt,0) AS montlyCredit,
CASE WHEN creditCardDetail.totalAmt>=100 THEN 0 ELSE -5 END AS charges
FROM months LEFT JOIN creditCardDetail ON months.month_id=creditCardDetail.months
LEFT JOIN transactionData ON transactionData.months=months.month_id
),
monthlyCalc AS (
SELECT month_id, (montlyCredit + charges - monthlyDebit) AS finalMonthlyAmt
FROM overallData
)

SELECT SUM(finalMonthlyAmt) AS finalBalance FROM monthlyCalc

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (
select month(transaction_date)  as tran_month ,amount
 from transactions
)
,cte2 as (
select tran_month
, sum(amount) as net_amount , sum(case when amount<0 then -1*amount else 0 end) as credit_card_amount
, sum(case when amount<0 then 1 else 0 end) as credit_card_transact_cnt
from cte 
group by tran_month
)
select sum(net_amount) - sum(case when credit_card_amount >=100 and credit_card_transact_cnt >=2 then 0 else 5 end)
- 5*(12-(select count(distinct tran_month) from cte)) as final_balance
from cte2;

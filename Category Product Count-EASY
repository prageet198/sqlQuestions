Question:-
You are provided with a table that lists various product categories, each containing a comma-separated list of products. 
Your task is to write a SQL query to count the number of products in each category. Sort the result by product count.
Tables: categories
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| category    | varchar(15) |
| products    | varchar(30) |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH splitedData AS(
  select category ,
value AS product
from categories
CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(products, ',')
  )
  SELECT category,
  COUNT(*) AS productCount
  FROM splitedData
  GROUP BY category
  ORDER BY COUNT(*)

Actual Solution:-
SELECT 
        category,
        LENGTH(products) - LENGTH(REPLACE(products, ',', '')) + 1 AS product_count
    FROM 
        categories
ORDER BY product_count;

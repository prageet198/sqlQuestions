My Solution:-
select 
SUM(CASE WHEN JobTitle LIKE'Software%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Software_Engineers,
SUM(CASE WHEN JobTitle LIKE'Data%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Data_Professionals,
SUM(CASE WHEN JobTitle LIKE'%Manager%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Managers
from employees;

Acutual Solution:-
with cte as (
SELECT *
, case when JobTitle like 'Software%' Then 'Software Engineers'
when JobTitle like 'Data%' Then 'Data Professionals'
when JobTitle like '%Manager%' Then 'Managers'
end as emp_group
FROM employees
)
, cte1 as (
select emp_group,count(*) as cnt
from cte
group by emp_group
)
select 
sum(case when emp_group='Software Engineers' then cnt end) as Software_Engineers,
sum(case when emp_group='Data Professionals' then cnt end) as Data_Professionals,
sum(case when emp_group='Managers' then cnt end) as Managers
from cte1

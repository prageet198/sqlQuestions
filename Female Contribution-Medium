Question:-
You are given a history of credit card transaction data for the people of India across cities. Write an SQL to find percentage contribution of spends by females in each city.  
Round the percentage to 2 decimal places. Display city, total spend , female spend and female contribution in ascending order of city.

Table: credit_card_transactions
+------------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME      | DATA_TYPE   |
+------------------+-------------+
| amount           | int         |
| card_type        | varchar(10) |
| city             | varchar(10) |
| gender           | varchar(1)  |
| transaction_date | date        |
| transaction_id   | int         |
+------------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH totalSpend AS (
  SELECT city, SUM(amount) AS totalSpendAmt
  FROM credit_card_transactions
  GROUP BY city
  ),
  femalTotalSpend AS (
    SELECT city, SUM(amount) AS totalFemalSpendAmt
    FROM credit_card_transactions
    WHERE gender='F'
    GROUP BY city
    )
  
  SELECT totalSpend.city,
  totalSpend.totalSpendAmt,
  femalTotalSpend.totalFemalSpendAmt,
  ROUND((femalTotalSpend.totalFemalSpendAmt/totalSpend.totalSpendAmt)*100,2) AS femaleContribution
  FROM totalSpend INNER JOIN femalTotalSpend ON totalSpend.city=femalTotalSpend.city
  ORDER BY totalSpend.city

Actual Solution:-
select city,sum(amount) as total_spend
, sum(case when gender='F' then amount else 0 end) as female_spend
, round(sum(case when gender='F' then amount else 0 end)*1.0/sum(amount)*100,2) as female_contribution
from credit_card_transactions
group by city
ORDER BY city ;

Quetsion:-
Write a query to find workaholics employees.  Workaholics employees are those who satisfy at least one of the given criterions:

1- Worked for more than 8 hours a day for at least 3 days in a week. 
2- worked for more than 10 hours a day for at least 2 days in a week. 
You are given the login and logout timings of all the employees for a given week. Write a SQL to find all the workaholic employees 
along with the criterion that they are satisfying (1,2 or both), display it in the order of increasing employee id

Table: employees
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| emp_id      | int       |
| login       | datetime  |
| logout      | datetime  |
+-------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH empData AS (
select emp_id,
TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND,login,logout)/3600.0 AS total_hours
from employees
  ),
  filterData AS(
SELECT emp_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN total_hours>8 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS criteria1,
SUM(CASE WHEN total_hours>10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS citeria2
FROM empData
GROUP BY emp_id
    )
 SELECT emp_id,
 CASE WHEN criteria1>=3 AND citeria2<2 THEN 1
 	  WHEN criteria1<3 AND citeria2>=2 THEN 2
      ELSE 'both' END AS criterian 
 FROM filterData
 WHERE criteria1>=3 OR citeria2>=2

Actual Solution:-
with logged_hours as (
select *,TIMESTAMPDIFF(second, login, logout)/3600.0,case when TIMESTAMPDIFF(second, login, logout) / 3600.0  > 10 then '10+'
when TIMESTAMPDIFF(second, login, logout) / 3600.0  > 8 then '8+'
else '8-' end as time_window
from employees)
 , time_window as (
 select emp_id , count(*) as days_8
, sum(case when time_window='10+' then 1 else 0 end ) as days_10
 from logged_hours
where time_window in ('10+','8+')
 group by emp_id)
 select emp_id, case when days_8 >=3 and days_10>=2 then 'both'
 when days_8 >=3 then '1'
 else '2' end as criterian
 from time_window
  where days_8>=3 or days_10>=2 
ORDER BY emp_id ASC;

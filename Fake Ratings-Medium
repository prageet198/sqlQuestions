Question:-
As an analyst at Amazon, you are responsible for ensuring the integrity of product ratings on the platform. Fake ratings can distort the perception of product quality 
and mislead customers. To maintain trust and reliability, you need to identify potential fake ratings that deviate significantly from the average ratings for each product.
Write an SQL query to identify the single rating that is farthest (in absolute value) from the average rating value for each product, display 
rating details in ascending order of rating id.

Table : product_ratings
+-------------+--------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE    |
+-------------+--------------+
| rating_id   | int          |
| product_id  | int          |
| user_id     | int          |
| rating      | decimal(2,1) |
+-------------+--------------+

My Solution:-
WITH productAvgRating AS (
select product_id, AVG(rating) AS avgRating
from product_ratings
GROUP BY product_id
  ),
 finestRating AS( 
SELECT product_ratings.rating_id, product_ratings.product_id, product_ratings.user_id, product_ratings.rating,
productAvgRating.avgRating, ABS(product_ratings.rating-productAvgRating.avgRating) AS ratingDiff,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY product_ratings.product_id ORDER BY ABS(product_ratings.rating-productAvgRating.avgRating) DESC) AS ranked
FROM product_ratings INNER JOIN productAvgRating ON product_ratings.product_id=productAvgRating.product_id
   )
   
   SELECT rating_id, product_id,user_id,rating
   FROM finestRating WHERE ranked=1
   ORDER BY rating_id

Actual Solution:-
WITH rating_stats AS (
    SELECT product_id,AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
    FROM product_ratings
    GROUP BY product_id
),
farthest_rating AS (
    SELECT pr.rating_id,pr.product_id,pr.user_id,pr.rating,rs.avg_rating,
        ABS(pr.rating - rs.avg_rating) AS rating_difference,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY pr.product_id ORDER BY ABS(pr.rating - rs.avg_rating) DESC) AS rn
    FROM
        product_ratings pr JOIN rating_stats rs ON pr.product_id = rs.product_id
)
SELECT rating_id,product_id,user_id,rating
FROM farthest_rating
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY rating_id;

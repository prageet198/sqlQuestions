Question:-
You are given an orders table that contains information about customer purchases, including the products they bought. Write a query 
to find all customers who have purchased both "Laptop" and "Mouse", but have never purchased "Phone Case". Additionally, 
include the total number of distinct products purchased by these customers. Sort the result by customer id.

Table: orders 
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| customer_id | int      |
| order_id    | int      |
| product_name| varchar  |
+-------------+----------+

My Solution:-
WITH bothCase AS(
  SELECT customer_id,COUNT(DISTINCT (product_name)) AS totalPurchased
FROM orders
WHERE product_name IN ('Laptop', 'Mouse')
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT (product_name))=2
),
noPhoneCase AS(
  SELECT DISTINCT(customer_id) AS customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT(customer_id) AS customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE product_name  LIKE 'Phone Case')
)

SELECT bothCase.customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT product_name) AS totalDistProducts
FROM bothCase INNER JOIN orders ON bothCase.customer_id=orders .customer_id
WHERE bothCase.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM noPhoneCase)
GROUP BY bothCase.customer_id

Actual Solution:-
select customer_id, count(distinct product_name) as total_distinct_products
from orders 
where customer_id not in (select customer_id from orders where product_name='Phone Case')
group by customer_id
having count(distinct case when product_name in ('Laptop','Mouse') then product_name end)=2
order by customer_id;

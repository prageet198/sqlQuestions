Question:-
Given a sales dataset that records daily transactions for various products, write an SQL query to calculate last quarter's total sales and quarter-to-date (QTD) sales 
for each product, helping analyze past performance and current trends.

 

Table: sales
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| product_id  | int      | 
| sale_date   | date     | 
| sale_amount | int      | 
+-------------+----------+

My Solution:-
-- Calculate quarter-to-date start date
with qtd_start AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(
        DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL (MOD(MONTH(CURDATE())-1, 3)) MONTH),
        '%Y-%m-01'
    ) AS current_qtr_start
),
DateRanges as (
select current_qtr_start,current_qtr_start - INTERVAL 1 QUARTER as last_qtr_start
,current_qtr_start - INTERVAL 1 DAY as last_qtr_end
from qtd_start
),
SalesData AS (
    SELECT 
        product_id,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN sale_date >= (SELECT last_qtr_start FROM DateRanges) 
                 AND sale_date <= (SELECT last_qtr_end FROM DateRanges) 
            THEN sales_amount 
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS last_quarter_sales,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN sale_date >= (SELECT current_qtr_start FROM DateRanges) 
                 AND sale_date <= CURRENT_DATE 
            THEN sales_amount 
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS qtd_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY product_id
)
SELECT product_id, last_quarter_sales, qtd_sales
FROM SalesData;

Question:-
You work in the Human Resources (HR) department of a growing company that tracks the status of its employees year over year. The company needs to analyze employee 
status changes between two consecutive years: 2020 and 2021.

The company's HR system has two separate records of employees for the years 2020 and 2021 in the same table, which include each employee's 
unique identifier (emp_id) and their corresponding designation (role) within the organization for each year.

The task is to track how the designations of employees have changed over the year. Specifically, you are required to identify the following changes:

Promoted: If an employee's designation has changed (e.g., from Trainee to Developer, or from Developer to Manager).
Resigned: If an employee was present in 2020 but has left the company by 2021.
New Hire: If an employee was hired in 2021 but was not present in 2020.

Assume that employees can only be promoted and cannot be demoted.

Table: employees
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| emp_id      | int      |
| year        | int      | 
| designation | date     |
+-------------+----------+

My Solution:-
SELECT 
    COALESCE(e20.emp_id, e21.emp_id) AS emp_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN e20.designation != e21.designation THEN 'Promoted'
        WHEN e21.designation IS NULL THEN 'Resigned'
        ELSE 'New Hire'
    END AS comment
FROM employees e20
LEFT JOIN employees e21 ON e20.emp_id = e21.emp_id and e21.year=2021
WHERE e20.year=2020 
   and (e20.designation != e21.designation 
   OR e20.designation IS NULL 
   OR e21.designation IS NULL)

UNION 

SELECT 
    COALESCE(e20.emp_id, e21.emp_id) AS emp_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN e20.designation != e21.designation THEN 'Promoted'
        WHEN e21.designation IS NULL THEN 'Resigned'
        ELSE 'New Hire'
    END AS comment
FROM employees e21
LEFT JOIN employees e20 ON e20.emp_id = e21.emp_id and e20.year=2020 
WHERE e21.year=2021
	and (e20.designation != e21.designation 
   OR e20.designation IS NULL 
   OR e21.designation IS NULL);

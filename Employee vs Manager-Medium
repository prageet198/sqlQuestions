Question:-
You are given the table of employee details. Write an SQL to find details of employee with salary more than their manager salary but they joined the company 
after the manager joined.
Display employee name, salary and joining date along with their manager's salary and joining date, sort the output in ascending order of employee name.

Table: employee
+--------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE   |
+--------------+-------------+
| emp_id       | int         |
| emp_name     | varchar(10) |
| joining_date | date        |
| salary       | int         |
| manager_id   | int         |
+--------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
select emp.emp_name AS employeeName,
emp.salary AS employeeSalary,
emp.joining_date AS employeeJoiningDate,
 mgr.salary AS managerSalary,
 mgr.joining_date AS managerJoiningDate
from employee AS emp INNER JOIN employee AS mgr
ON emp.manager_id=mgr.emp_id
WHERE emp.salary>mgr.salary AND (emp.joining_date>mgr.joining_date)

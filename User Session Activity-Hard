Question:-
You are given a table user events that tracks user activity with the following schema:

Table: events
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| user_id     | int      |    
| event_type  | varchar  |
| event_time  | timestamp|
+-------------+----------+
Task:

1. Identify user sessions. A session is defined as a sequence of activities by a user where the time difference between consecutive events is 
less than or equal to 30 minutes. If the time between two events exceeds 30 minutes, it's considered the start of a new session.

2. For each session, calculate the following metrics:

session_id : a unique identifier for each session.

session_start_time : the timestamp of the first event in the session.

session_end_time : the timestamp of the last event in the session.

session_duration : the difference between session_end_time and session_start_time.

event_count : the number of events in the session.

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS (
  SELECT userid, event_type, event_time,
 LAG(event_time, 1, event_time) OVER(PARTITION BY userid ORDER BY event_time) AS previouTime,
TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, LAG(event_time, 1, event_time) OVER(PARTITION BY userid ORDER BY event_time), event_time) AS timeDiff
  FROM events
),
flaging AS (
  SELECT userid, event_type, event_time, previouTime,
 CASE WHEN timeDiff <= 30 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS flag
  FROM initialData
),
groupings AS(
SELECT userid, event_type, event_time, previouTime,
SUM(flag) OVER(PARTITION BY userid ORDER BY event_time) AS groupId
FROM flaging
)
SELECT 
  userid, 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY userid ORDER BY MIN(event_time)) AS sessionId, 
  MIN(event_time) AS sessionStart, 
  MAX(event_time) AS sessionEnd, 
  TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, MIN(event_time), MAX(event_time)) AS sessionDuration, 
  COUNT(*) AS totalCount
FROM groupings
GROUP BY 
  userid, 
  groupId

Question:-
Given a sample table with emails sent vs. received by the users, calculate the response rate (%) which is given as emails sent/ emails received. 
For simplicity consider sent emails are delivered. List all the users that fall under the top 25 percent based on the highest response rate.
Please consider users who have sent at least one email and have received at least one email.

Table : gmail_data
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| from_user   | varchar(20) |
| to_user     | varchar(20) |
| email_day   | date        |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH totalSend AS(
SELECT from_user, COUNT(*) AS totalEmailSent
from gmail_data
GROUP BY from_user
),
totalReceived AS(
SELECT to_user, COUNT(*) AS totalEmailReceive
from gmail_data
GROUP BY to_user
),
finalData AS(
SELECT totalSend.from_user, (totalEmailSent/totalEmailReceive)*100.0 AS responseRate,
ntile(4) OVER(ORDER BY (totalEmailSent *1.0 /totalEmailReceive) DESC) AS quartile
FROM totalSend INNER JOIN totalReceived
ON totalSend.from_user=totalReceived.to_user
WHERE totalEmailSent>=1 AND totalEmailReceive>=1
)
SELECT from_user, responseRate
FROM finalData
WHERE quartile='1'

Actual Solution:-
WITH sent_emails as (
  SELECT
    from_user,
    COUNT(*) as emails_sent
  FROM
    gmail_data g1
  GROUP BY 1
),
received_emails as (
  SELECT
    to_user,
    COUNT(*) as emails_received
  FROM
    gmail_data g2
  GROUP BY 1
),
summarized_view as (
  SELECT
    from_user as user_id,
    (emails_sent * 100.0 / emails_received) as response_rate,
    ntile(4) OVER (ORDER BY (emails_sent * 1.0 / emails_received) desc) as quartile
  FROM
    sent_emails
    inner JOIN received_emails on sent_emails.from_user = received_emails.to_user
)
SELECT
  user_id,
  response_rate
FROM
  summarized_view
WHERE quartile=1  ;

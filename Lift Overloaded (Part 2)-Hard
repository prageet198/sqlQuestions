Question:-
You are given a table of list of lifts , their maximum capacity and people along with their weight and gender who wants to enter into it. 
You need to make sure maximum people enter into the lift without lift getting overloaded but you need to give preference to female passengers first.

For each lift find the comma separated list of people who can be accomodated. The comma separated list should have female first and 
then people in the order of their weight in increasing order, display the output in increasing order of id.

Table: lifts 
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| capacity_kg | int       |
| id          | int       |
+-------------+-----------+
Table: lift_passengers
+----------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME    | DATA_TYPE   |
+----------------+-------------+
| passenger_name | varchar(10) |
| weight_kg      | int         |
| gender         | varchar(1)  |
| lift_id        | int         |
+----------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH overallData AS(
SELECT passenger_name,
weight_kg,
gender,
lift_id,
SUM(weight_kg) OVER(PARTITION BY lift_id ORDER BY gender, weight_kg) AS runningWt,
capacity_kg
FROM lift_passengers INNER JOIN lifts ON lift_passengers.lift_id=lifts.id
  )
SELECT lift_id, GROUP_CONCAT(passenger_name) AS passengerList
FROM overallData
WHERE runningWt<=capacity_kg
GROUP BY lift_id

Actual Solution:-
with running_weight as (
select l.id , lp.passenger_name ,lp.weight_kg,l.capacity_kg,lp.gender
, sum(lp.weight_kg) over(partition by l.id order by case when lp.gender='F' then 0 else 1 end, lp.weight_kg rows between unbounded preceding and current row) as running_sum
from lifts l
inner join lift_passengers lp on l.id=lp.lift_id
)
select id, GROUP_CONCAT(passenger_name ORDER BY gender,weight_kg SEPARATOR',') as passenger_list
from running_weight
where running_sum < capacity_kg
group by id
ORDER BY id;

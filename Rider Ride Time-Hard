Question:-
You are working with Zomato, a food delivery platform, and you need to analyze the performance of Zomato riders in terms of the time they 
spend delivering orders each day. Given the pickup and delivery times for each order, your task is to calculate the duration of time spent by 
each rider on deliveries each day.  Order the output by rider id and ride date.

Table:orders 
+---------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE |
+---------------+-----------+
| rider_id      | int       |
| order_id      | int       |
| pickup_time   | datetime  |
| delivery_time | datetime  |
+---------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
SELECT rider_id, DATE(pickup_time) AS rideDate,
TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, pickup_time, delivery_time) AS rideTime
FROM orders
WHERE DATE(pickup_time)=DATE(delivery_time)
UNION ALL
SELECT rider_id, DATE(pickup_time) AS rideDate,
TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, pickup_time, DATE(delivery_time)) AS rideTime
FROM orders
WHERE DATE(pickup_time)!=DATE(delivery_time)
UNION ALL
SELECT rider_id, DATE(delivery_time) AS rideDate,
TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, DATE(delivery_time), delivery_time) AS rideTime
FROM orders
WHERE DATE(pickup_time)!=DATE(delivery_time)
)

SELECT rider_id, rideDate, SUM(rideTime) AS totalRideTime
FROM initialData
WHERE rideTime!=0
GROUP BY rider_id, rideDate
ORDER BY rider_id, rideDate


Actual Solution:-
with cte as 
(
select order_id,rider_id,CAST(pickup_time AS DATE) as ride_date
,TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, pickup_time,delivery_time) as ride_time
 from orders
 where CAST(pickup_time AS DATE)=CAST(delivery_time AS DATE)

union all

select order_id,rider_id, CAST(pickup_time AS DATE) as ride_date
,TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, pickup_time,CAST(delivery_time as DATE)) as ride_time
 from orders
where CAST(pickup_time AS DATE)!=CAST(delivery_time AS DATE)

union all

select order_id,rider_id, CAST(delivery_time AS DATE) as ride_date
,TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,CAST(delivery_time as DATE), delivery_time) as ride_time
 from orders
where CAST(pickup_time AS DATE)!=CAST(delivery_time AS DATE)
)
select rider_id,ride_date,sum(ride_time) as ride_time_mins
 from cte
where ride_time!=0
group by rider_id,ride_date
order by rider_id,ride_date;

Question:-
Sachin Tendulkar - Also known as little master. You are given runs scored by Sachin in his first 10 matches. You need to write an SQL 
to get match number when he completed 500 runs and his batting average at the end of 10 matches.

Batting Average = (Total runs scored) / (no of times batsman got out)

Round the result to 2 decimal places.

Table: sachin
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| match_no    | int         |
| runs_scored | int         |
| status      | varchar(10) |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH matchAnl AS (
SELECT match_no, SUM(runs_scored) OVER(ORDER BY match_no) AS runningScore
FROM sachin
  ),
 battingAvg AS(
   SELECT 
ROUND(SUM(runs_scored)/SUM(CASE WHEN status='out' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),2) AS battingAvg
FROM sachin
   )
   SELECT match_no,battingAvg
   FROM matchAnl INNER JOIN battingAvg ON 1=1
   WHERE runningScore>500
   LIMIT 1

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (
select *
,sum(runs_scored) over()*1.0 / sum(case when status='out' then 1 else 0 end) over() as batting_average
,sum(runs_scored) over(order by match_no rows between unbounded preceding and current row) as running_sum
from sachin
)
select match_no,CAST(round(batting_average,2) as DECIMAL(10,2)) as batting_average
from (select *, row_number() over(order by running_sum) as rn
from cte where running_sum>500) s
where rn=1;

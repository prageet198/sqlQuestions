Question:-
Netflixâ€™s analytics team wants to identify the Top 3 most popular shows based on the viewing patterns of its users. The definition of "popular" is based on two factors:

Unique Watchers: The total number of distinct users who have watched a show.
Total Watch Duration: The cumulative time users have spent watching the show.
In the case of ties in the number of unique watchers, the total watch duration will serve as the tie-breaker.
Write an SQL query to determine the Top 3 shows based on the above criteria. The output should be sorted by show_id and should include: show_id , unique_watchers, total_duration.

Table: watch_history 
+---------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE|
+---------------+----------+
| user_id       | int      |
| show_id       | int      |
| watch_date    | int      |
| watch_duration| int      |
+--------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH aggregated_data AS (
    SELECT 
        show_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS unique_watchers,
        SUM(watch_duration) AS total_duration
    FROM 
        watch_history
    GROUP BY 
        show_id
),
ranked_shows AS (
    SELECT 
        show_id,
        unique_watchers,
        total_duration,
        RANK() OVER (
            ORDER BY 
                unique_watchers DESC, 
                total_duration DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM 
        aggregated_data
)
SELECT 
    show_id,
    unique_watchers,
    total_duration
FROM 
    ranked_shows
WHERE 
    rn <= 3
order by show_id
;

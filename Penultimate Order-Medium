Question:-
You are a data analyst working for an e-commerce company, responsible for analysing customer orders to gain insights into their purchasing behaviour. 
Your task is to write a SQL query to retrieve the details of the penultimate order for each customer. However, if a customer has placed only one order, 
you need to retrieve the details of that order instead, display the output in ascending order of customer name.

Table: orders
+---------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE   |
+---------------+-------------+
| order_id      | int         |
| order_date    | date        |
| customer_name | varchar(10) |
| product_name  | varchar(10) |
| sales         | int         |
+---------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
  SELECT *,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_name ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS ranked,
  COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_name) AS totalOrders
  FROM orders)
  
  SELECT order_id, order_date,customer_name, product_name, sales
  FROM initialData
  WHERE ranked=2 OR totalOrders=1
  ORDER BY customer_name

Question:-
boAt Lifestyle is focusing on influencer marketing to build and scale their brand. They want to partner with power creators for their upcoming campaigns. 
The creators should satisfy below conditions to qualify:

1- They should have 100k+ followers on at least 2 social media platforms and
2- They should have at least 50k+ views on their latest YouTube video.
Write an SQL to get creator id and name satisfying above conditions.
Table: creators
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| id          | int         |
| name        | varchar(10) |
| followers   | int         |
| platform    | varchar(10) |
+-------------+-------------+
Table: youtube_videos
+--------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE |
+--------------+-----------+
| id           | int       |
| creator_id   | int       |
| publish_date | date      |
| views        | int       |
+--------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH creatorData AS(
select id, name,
SUM(CASE WHEN followers>'100000' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS status
from creators
GROUP BY id, name
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN followers>'100000' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)>=2
  ),
  youTubeData AS (
  SELECT creator_id,
  publish_date,
  views,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY creator_id ORDER BY publish_date DESC) AS ranked
  FROM youtube_videos)
  
  SELECT id,name
  FROM creatorData INNER JOIN youTubeData
  ON creatorData.id=youTubeData.creator_id
  WHERE ranked='1' AND views>50000

Actual Solution:-
with condition_1 as (
select id,name
 from creators
 where followers > 100000
 group by id,name
 having count(*)>=2
)
,condition_2 as 
(
select *, row_number() over(partition by creator_id order by publish_date desc) as rn    
from youtube_videos
)
select c1.id,c1.name from condition_2 c2
inner join condition_1 c1 on c1.id=c2.creator_id
where rn=1 and views>50000;

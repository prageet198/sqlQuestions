Question:-
In the field of pharmacovigilance, it's crucial to monitor and assess adverse reactions that patients may experience after taking certain medications. 
Adverse reactions, also known as side effects, can range from mild to severe and can impact the safety and efficacy of a medication.
For each medication, count the number of adverse reactions reported within the first 30 days of the prescription being issued. 
Assume that the prescription date in the Prescriptions table represents the start date of the medication usage, display the output in ascending order of medication name.

My Solution:-
WITH prescriptionData AS(
select patient_id,
medication_id,
prescription_date,
DATE_ADD(prescription_date, INTERVAL 29 DAY) AS prescriptionEndDate
from prescriptions
  ),
  calculation AS (
  SELECT prescriptionData.patient_id,
  prescriptionData.medication_id,
  prescriptionData.prescription_date,
  prescriptionData.prescriptionEndDate,
  adverse_reactions.reaction_date
  FROM prescriptionData INNER JOIN adverse_reactions ON prescriptionData.patient_id=adverse_reactions.patient_id AND (adverse_reactions.reaction_date BETWEEN prescriptionData.prescription_date AND prescriptionData.prescriptionEndDate)
    ),
    fineCalculation AS(
    SELECT medication_id,
    COUNT(*) AS totalAdverseReaction
    FROM calculation
    GROUP BY calculation.medication_id
      )
      SELECT medications.medication_name,
      medications.manufacturer,
      IFNULL(totalAdverseReaction,0) AS totalAdverseReaction
      FROM medications LEFT JOIN fineCalculation ON
      medications.medication_id=fineCalculation.medication_id
      ORDER BY medications.medication_name

Actual Solution:-
SELECT 
    m.medication_name,
    m.manufacturer,
    COUNT(AR.reaction_id) AS num_adverse_reactions
FROM 
    Medications m
INNER JOIN 
    Prescriptions p ON M.medication_id = p.medication_id
LEFT JOIN 
    adverse_reactions ar ON p.patient_id = AR.patient_id
                        AND AR.reaction_date BETWEEN P.prescription_date AND DATE_ADD(P.prescription_date , INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY 
    m.medication_name, m.manufacturer
ORDER BY m.medication_name;

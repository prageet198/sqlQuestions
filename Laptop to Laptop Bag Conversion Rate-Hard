Question:-
The marketing team at a retail company wants to analyze customer purchasing behavior. They are particularly interested in understanding how many customers 
who bought a laptop later went on to purchase a laptop bag, with no intermediate purchases in between. Write an SQL to get number of customer in each country 
who bought laptop and number of customers who bought laptop bag just after buying a laptop. Order the result by country.

Table: transactions
+----------------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME          | DATA_TYPE  |
+----------------------+------------+
| transaction_id       | int        |
| customer_id          | date       |
| product_name         | varchar(10)|
| transaction_timestamp| datetime   |
| country              | varchar(5) |
+----------------------+------------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
SELECT customer_id, product_name,country,
LEAD(product_name,1) OVER(PARTITION BY country,customer_id ORDER BY transaction_timestamp) AS nextProduct
from transactions
)
SELECT country,
SUM(CASE WHEN product_name='Laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptopFlag,
SUM(CASE WHEN product_name='Laptop' AND nextProduct='Laptop Bag' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptopBagFlag
FROM initialData
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country

Actual Solution:-
WITH RankedPurchases AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        product_name,
        transaction_timestamp,
        country,
        LEAD(product_name) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, country ORDER BY transaction_timestamp) AS next_product
    FROM transactions
)
SELECT
    country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN product_name = 'Laptop' THEN customer_id END) AS laptop_customers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN product_name = 'Laptop' AND next_product = 'Laptop Bag' THEN customer_id END) AS laptop_bag_customers
FROM RankedPurchases
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country;

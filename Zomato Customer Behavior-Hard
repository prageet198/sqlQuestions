DIFFICULTY:-Hard
COMPANY:-Zomato

Question:-
Suppose you are a data analyst working for Zomato (a online food delivery company) . Zomato is interested in analysing customer food ordering behavior 
and wants to identify customers who have exhibited inconsistent patterns over time.

Your task is to write an SQL query to identify customers who have placed orders on both weekdays and weekends, but with a significant difference 
in the average order amount between weekdays and weekends. Specifically, you need to identify customers who have a minimum of 3 orders placed both on weekdays and weekends each, and where the average order amount on weekends is at least 20% higher than the average order amount on weekdays.

Your query should return the customer id, the average order amount on weekends, the average order amount on weekdays, and the percentage 
difference in average order amount between weekends and weekdays for each customer meeting the criteria.

Table: orders
+--------------+---------------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE     |
+--------------+---------------+
| order_id     | int           |
| customer_id  | int           |
| order_amount | decimal(10,2) |
| order_date   | date          |
+--------------+---------------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS (
SELECT *,CASE WHEN WEEKDAY(order_date) IN ('5', '6') THEN 'Weekend' ELSE 'Weekday' END AS dayType
FROM orders
),
overallOrder AS(
SELECT customer_id, dayType, COUNT(dayType) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, dayType) AS totalOrders,
AVG(order_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, dayType) AS avgOrders
FROM initialData
),
weekendWeekDayOrders AS(
SELECT customer_id,
MAX(CASE WHEN dayType='Weekend' THEN totalOrders END) AS totalWeekEndOrders,
MAX(CASE WHEN dayType='Weekday' THEN totalOrders END) AS totalWeekdayOrders,
MAX(CASE WHEN dayType='Weekend' THEN avgOrders END) AS weekendAvgAmt,
MAX(CASE WHEN dayType='Weekday' THEN avgOrders END) AS weekdayAvgAmt
FROM overallOrder
GROUP BY customer_id
 )
 SELECT customer_id, weekendAvgAmt, weekdayAvgAmt,
 (weekendAvgAmt-weekdayAvgAmt)*100.0 / weekdayAvgAmt AS percentDiff
 FROM weekendWeekDayOrders
 WHERE weekendAvgAmt>1.2*weekdayAvgAmt AND totalWeekEndOrders>=3 AND totalWeekdayOrders>=3

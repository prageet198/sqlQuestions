Question:-
LinkedIn is a professional social networking app. They want to give top voice badge to their best creators to encourage them to create more quality content. 
A creator qualifies for the badge if he/she satisfies following criteria.
1- Creator should have more than 50k followers.
2- Creator should have more than 100k impressions on the posts that they published in the month of Dec-2023.
3- Creator should have published atleast 3 posts in Dec-2023.

Write a SQL to get the list of top voice creators name along with no of posts and impressions by them in the month of Dec-2023.

Table: creators(primary key : creator_id)
+--------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE   |
+--------------+-------------+
| creator_id   | int         |
| creator_name | varchar(20) |
| followers    | int         |
+--------------+-------------+
Table: posts(primary key : post_id)
+--------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE  |
+--------------+------------+
| creator_id   | int        |
| post_id      | varchar(3) |
| publish_date | date       |
| impressions  | int        |
+--------------+------------+

My Solution:-
WITH postData AS (
select creator_id, COUNT(post_id) AS totalPost, SUM(impressions) AS totalImpressions
from posts
WHERE YEAR(publish_date)='2023' AND MONTH(publish_date)='12'
GROUP BY creator_id)
SELECT creator_name, totalPost, totalImpressions
FROM creators INNER JOIN postData
ON creators.creator_id=postData.creator_id
WHERE followers>'50000' AND totalImpressions>'100000' AND totalPost>='3'

Actual Solution:-
select c.creator_name,count(p.post_id) as no_of_posts, sum(p.impressions) as total_impressions
from creators c
inner join posts p on c.creator_id=p.creator_id
where c.followers>50000 and DATE_FORMAT(p.publish_date,'%Y%m')='202312'
group by c.creator_name
having sum(p.impressions)>100000 and count(p.post_id)>=3 ;

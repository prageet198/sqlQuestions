Question:-
You are given a history of credit card transaction data for the people of India across cities as below. Your task is to find out highest spend card type and 
lowest spent card type for each city, display the output in ascending order of city.

Table: credit_card_transactions
+------------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME      | DATA_TYPE   |
+------------------+-------------+
| transaction_id   | int         |
| city             | varchar(10) |
| transaction_date | date        |
| card_type        | varchar(12) |
| gender           | varchar(1)  |
| amount           | int         |
+------------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
select city, card_type, SUM(amount) AS totalSpend
from credit_card_transactions
GROUP BY city,card_type
  ),
  highestSpend AS (
  SELECT city,card_type,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY city ORDER BY totalSpend DESC) AS maxSpend
  FROM combineData
    ),
    lowestSpend AS (
      SELECT city,card_type,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY city ORDER BY totalSpend ASC) AS minSpend
  FROM combineData
      )
      SELECT highestSpend.city, highestSpend.card_type AS highestExpenseType,
      lowestSpend.card_type AS lowestExpenseType
      FROM highestSpend INNER JOIN lowestSpend ON highestSpend.city=lowestSpend.city AND highestSpend.maxSpend='1' AND lowestSpend.minSpend='1'
      ORDER BY highestSpend.city

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (
select city,card_type,sum(amount) as total_spend 
from credit_card_transactions
group by city,card_type
)
,cte2 as (
select *
,rank() over(partition by city order by total_spend desc) rn_high
,rank() over(partition by city order by total_spend) rn_low
from cte
)
select city
, max(case when rn_high=1 then card_type end) as highest_expense_type
, max(case when rn_low=1 then card_type end) as lowest_expense_type
from cte2
where rn_high=1 or rn_low=1
group by city
ORDER BY city;

Question:-
Myntra marketing team wants to measure the effectiveness of recent campaigns aimed at acquiring new customers. A new customer is defined as someone who made 
their first-ever purchase during a specific period, with no prior purchase history.

They have asked you to identify the new customers acquired in the last 3 months, excluding the current month. Output should display customer id and 
their first purchase date. Order the result by customer id.
For example:
If today is March 15, 2025, the SQL should give customers whose first purchase falls in the range from December 1, 2024, to February 28, 2025, 
and should not include any new customers made in March 2025.
 
Table: transactions
+---------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME     | DATA_TYPE|
+-----------------+----------+
| transaction_id  | int      |
| customer_id     | int      | 
| transaction_date| date     | 
| amount          | int      | 
+-----------------+----------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
SELECT customer_id, MIN(transaction_date) AS firstPurchased
from transactions
GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT *
FROM initialData
WHERE firstPurchased>= DATE_SUB(DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%Y-%m-01'), INTERVAL 3 MONTH) AND firstPurchased < DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%Y-%m-01')
ORDER BY customer_id

Actual Solution:-
WITH FirstPurchase AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        MIN(transaction_date) AS first_purchase_date
    FROM 
        transactions
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id
)
SELECT 
    fp.customer_id,
    fp.first_purchase_date
FROM 
    FirstPurchase fp
WHERE 
    fp.first_purchase_date >= DATE_SUB(DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%Y-%m-01'), INTERVAL 3 MONTH)  -- Start of 3 months ago (excluding current month)
    AND fp.first_purchase_date < DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%Y-%m-01')  -- Before the start of the current month
ORDER BY 
    fp.customer_id;

Question:-
Imagine you're working for a library and you're tasked with generating a report on the borrowing habits of patrons. You have two tables in your database: Books and Borrowers.
Write an SQL to display the name of each borrower along with a comma-separated list of the books they have borrowed in alphabetical order, 
display the output in ascending order of Borrower Name.
Tables: Books
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| BookID      | int         |
| BookName    | varchar(30) |
| Genre       | varchar(20) |
+-------------+-------------+

Tables: Borrowers
+--------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE   |
+--------------+-------------+
| BorrowerID   | int         |
| BorrowerName | varchar(10) |
| BookID       | int         |
+--------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
select BorrowerName,
STRING_AGG(Books.BookName,',') WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY Books.BookName ASC) AS borrowedBooks
from Borrowers INNER JOIN Books
ON Borrowers.BookID=Books.BookID
GROUP BY BorrowerName

Acutual Solution:-
SELECT     b.BorrowerName,
    GROUP_CONCAT(bk.BookName order by bk.BookName SEPARATOR ',') AS BorrowedBooks
FROM
    Borrowers b
    INNER JOIN Books bk ON b.BookID = bk.BookID
GROUP BY
    b.BorrowerName
ORDER BY
	b.BorrowerName ASC

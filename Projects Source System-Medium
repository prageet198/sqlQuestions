Question:-
A company manages project data from three source systems with varying reliability:

EagleEye: The most reliable and prioritized internal system.
SwiftLink: A trusted partner system with moderate reliability.
DataVault: A third-party system used as a fallback.
Data for a project can come from multiple systems. For each project, you need to select the most reliable data by prioritizing the source systems: EagleEye > SwiftLink > DataVault

Write an SQL to display id , project number and selected source system.

Table: projects
+----------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME    | DATA_TYPE|
+----------------+----------+
| id             | int      |
| project_number | int      | 
| Source_System  | varchar  |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY project_number ORDER BY CASE WHEN Source_System='EagleEye' THEN 1 WHEN Source_System='SwiftLink' THEN 2 ELSE 3 END) AS ranked
FROM projects
)
SELECT id, project_number, source_system
FROM initialData
WHERE ranked='1'

Actual Solution:-
WITH RankedData AS (
    SELECT
        ID,
        Project_Number,
        Source_System,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY Project_Number
            ORDER BY 
                CASE 
                    WHEN Source_System = 'EagleEye' THEN 1
                    WHEN Source_System = 'SwiftLink' THEN 2
                    WHEN Source_System = 'DataVault' THEN 3
                END
        ) AS rn
    FROM
        projects
)
-- Select the data with the highest priority
SELECT 
     id,project_number, source_system
FROM RankedData
WHERE rn = 1;

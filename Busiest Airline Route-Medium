Question:-
You are given a table named "tickets" containing information about airline tickets sold. Write an SQL query to find the busiest route based on the total 
number of tickets sold. Also display total ticket count for that route.
oneway_round ='O' -> One Way Trip 
oneway_round ='R' -> Round Trip 
Note: DEL -> BOM is different route from BOM -> DEL

Tables: tickets
+----------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME    | DATA_TYPE   |
+----------------+-------------+
| airline_number | varchar(10) |
| origin         | varchar(3)  |
| destination    | varchar(3)  |
| oneway_round   | char(1)     |
| ticket_count   | int         |
+----------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
select origin,destination,ticket_count
from tickets
UNION ALL
select destination, origin,ticket_count
from tickets
WHERE oneway_round='R'
  )
  SELECT origin,destination, SUM(ticket_count) AS totalTickets
  FROM combineData
  GROUP BY origin,destination
  ORDER BY totalTickets DESC
  LIMIT 1

Actual Solution:-
select origin,destination, SUM(ticket_count) as tc
 from (select origin,destination,ticket_count
 from tickets
 union all
  select destination,origin,ticket_count
 from tickets
 where oneway_round='R') A
 group by origin,destination
 order by tc desc	
 LIMIT 1;

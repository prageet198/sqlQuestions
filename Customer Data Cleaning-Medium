Question:-
You are given a table with customers information that contains inconsistent and messy data. Your task is to clean the data by writing an SQL query to:

1- Trim extra spaces from the customer name and email fields.
2- Convert all email addresses to lowercase for consistency.
3- Remove duplicate records based on email address (keep the record with lower customer id).
4- Standardize the phone number format to only contain digits (remove dashes, spaces, and special characters).
5- Replace NULL values in address with 'Unknown'.
Sort the output by customer id.
Table: customers
+---------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE|
+---------------+----------+
| customer_id   | int      |
| customer_name | varchar  | 
| email         | varchar  | 
| phone         | varchar  | 
| address       | varchar  | 
+---------------+----------+

My Solution:-
WITH RankedCustomers AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        TRIM(customer_name) AS customer_name,  -- Trim spaces from customer_name
        LOWER(TRIM(email)) AS email,  -- Convert email to lowercase and trim spaces
        REGEXP_REPLACE(phone, '[^0-9]', '') AS phone,  -- Remove non-digit characters from phone
        COALESCE(address, 'Unknown') AS address,  -- Replace NULL address with 'Unknown'
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY LOWER(TRIM(email)) ORDER BY customer_id) AS rn  
        -- Assigns a rank to each duplicate email, keeping the one with the lowest customer_id
    FROM customers
)
SELECT customer_id, customer_name, email, phone, address 
FROM RankedCustomers
WHERE rn = 1
order by customer_id;

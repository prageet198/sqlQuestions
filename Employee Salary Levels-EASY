Question:-
Write an SQL query to find the average salaries of employees at each salary level. "Salary Level" are defined as per below conditions:
If the salary is less than 50000, label it as "Low".
If the salary is between 50000 and 100000 (inclusive), label it as "Medium".
If the salary is greater than 100000, label it as "High".
Round the average to nearest integer. Display the output in ascending order of salary level.

Tables: Employees
+---------------+--------------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE    |
+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id   | int          |
| employee_name | varchar(20) |
| salary        | int          |
+---------------+--------------+

My Solution:-
WITH empSalaryLevel AS (
SELECT employee_id,
salary,
CASE WHEN salary<'50000' THEN 'Low'
	WHEN salary >='50000' AND salary <='100000' THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'High' END AS salaryLevel
from employees)

SELECT salaryLevel,
round(avg(salary),0)AS avgSalary
FROM empSalaryLevel
GROUP BY salaryLevel
ORDER BY salaryLevel

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (SELECT employee_name, salary,
    CASE
        WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'High'
    END AS Salary_Level
FROM 
    employees)
select Salary_Level , round(avg(salary),0) as avg_salary
from cte
group by Salary_Level 
ORDER BY Salary_Level ;

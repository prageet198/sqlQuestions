Question:-
You are tasked with analysing the sales data for products during the month of January 2024. Your goal is to calculate the rolling sum of sales 
for each product and each day of Jan 2024, considering the sales for the current day and the two previous days. Note that for some days, 
there might not be any sales for certain products, and you need to consider these days as having sales of 0.

You can make use of the calendar table which has the all the dates for Jan-2024.

Tables: orders
+-------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE  |
+-------------+------------+
| amount      | int        |
| order_date  | date       |
| order_id    | int        |
| product_id  | varchar(5) |
+-------------+------------+
Tables: calendar_dim
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| cal_date    | date      |
+-------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH aggregateProducts AS(
SELECT order_date, product_id, SUM(amount) AS totalSales
FROM orders
GROUP BY  order_date, product_id
),
allProductDates AS(
SELECT DISTINCT product_id, cal_date AS orderDate
FROM aggregateProducts CROSS JOIN calendar_dim
)
SELECT apd.product_id, apd.orderDate, COALESCE(ap.totalSales,0) AS sales,
SUM(COALESCE(ap.totalSales,0)) OVER(PARTITION BY apd.product_id ORDER BY apd.orderDate ROWS BETWEEN 2 preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS rollingSum
FROM allProductDates AS apd LEFT JOIN aggregateProducts AS ap
ON apd.product_id=ap.product_id AND apd.orderDate=ap.order_date
ORDER BY apd.product_id, apd.orderDate

Question:-
You are given a list of users and their opening account balance along with the transactions done by them. Write a SQL to calculate their account balance at 
the end of all the transactions. Please note that users can do transactions among themselves as well, display the output in ascending order of the final balance.

Table: users
+-----------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME     | DATA_TYPE   |
+-----------------+-------------+
| user_id         | int         |
| username        | varchar(10) |
| opening_balance | int         |
+-----------------+-------------+

Table: transactions
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| id          | int       |
| from_userid | int       |
| to_userid   | int       |
| amount      | int       |
+-------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH balance AS (
  SELECT user_id, username, opening_balance
  FROM users
  ),
  debitTransactions AS (
    SELECT from_userid, SUM(amount) AS totalDebit
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY from_userid
    ),
   creditTransactions AS (
     SELECT to_userid, SUM(amount) AS totalCredit
     FROM transactions
     GROUP BY to_userid
     ),
     calculation AS (
       SELECT balance.user_id, balance.username, balance.opening_balance,ISNULL(debitTransactions.totalDebit,'0') AS totalDebit, ISNULL(creditTransactions.totalCredit,'0') AS totalCredit
    FROM balance LEFT JOIN debitTransactions
    ON balance.user_id=debitTransactions.from_userid
    LEFT JOIN creditTransactions
    ON balance.user_id=creditTransactions.to_userid
       )
       
    SELECT username,
    (opening_balance-totalDebit+totalCredit) AS finalBalance
    FROM calculation
    ORDER BY finalBalance

Actual Solution:-
with all_trans as (
select from_userid as user_id    , -1*amount as amount from transactions 
union all
select to_userid, amount as amount from transactions 
)
,trans_amount as 
(select user_id,sum(amount) as transact_amount
from all_trans
group by user_id
)
select u.username , opening_balance + coalesce(transact_amount,0) as final_balance
from users u 
left join trans_amount t on u.user_id=t.user_id
ORDER BY final_balance ASC;

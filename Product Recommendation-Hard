DIFFICULTY:-Hard
COMPANY:-Amazon

Question:-
Product recommendation. Just the basic type (“customers who bought this also bought…”). That, in its simplest form, is an outcome of basket analysis. 
Write a SQL to find the product pairs which have been purchased together in same order along with the purchase frequency (count of times they have been purchased together). 

Based on this data Amazon can recommend frequently bought together products to other users.

Order the output by purchase frequency in descending order. Please make in the output first product column has id greater than second product column. 
Table: orders (primary key : order_id)
+-------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE  |
+-------------+------------+
| order_id    | int        |
| customer_id | int        |
| product_id  | varchar(2) |
+-------------+------------+

My Solution:-
select o1.product_id AS product1, o2.product_id AS product2,
COUNT(*) AS purchaseFre
from orders AS o1 INNER JOIN orders AS o2 ON o1.order_id=o2.order_id
WHERE o1.product_id>o2.product_id
GROUP BY o1.product_id,o2.product_id
ORDER BY purchaseFre DESC

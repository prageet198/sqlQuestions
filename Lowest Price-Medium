Question:-
You own a small online store, and want to analyze customer ratings for the products that you're selling. After doing a data pull, you have a list of products 
and a log of purchases. Within the purchase log, each record includes the number of stars (from 1 to 5) as a customer rating for the product.

For each category, find the lowest price among all products that received at least one 4-star or above rating from customers.
If a product category did not have any products that received at least one 4-star or above rating, the lowest price is considered to be 0. 
The final output should be sorted by product category in alphabetical order.

Table: products
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| category    | varchar(10) |
| id          | int         |
| name        | varchar(20) |
| price       | int         |
+-------------+-------------+
Table: purchases
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| id          | int       |
| product_id  | int       |
| stars       | int       |
+-------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH starFilter AS(
select purchases.product_id,
  products.category,
purchases.stars
from purchases INNER JOIN products ON purchases.product_id=products.id
WHERE stars=4
  ),
  combineData AS(
    SELECT products.id, products.category, products.price, starFilter.stars,
  CASE WHEN stars IS NULL THEN '0' ELSE price END AS flag
  FROM products LEFT JOIN starFilter ON products.category=starFilter.category AND products.id=starFilter.product_id
    )
    SELECT category, MAX(flag) AS finalPrice
    FROM combineData
    GROUP BY category
    ORDER BY category

Actual Solution:-
select category,coalesce(min(case when pur.product_id is not null then price end),0) as price
from products p
left join purchases pur on p.id=pur.product_id and pur.stars in (4,5)
group by category
order by category;

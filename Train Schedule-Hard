Question:-
You are given a table of  train schedule which contains the arrival and departure times of trains at each station on a given day. 
At each station one platform can accommodate only one train at a time, from the beginning of the minute the train arrives until the end of the minute it departs. 
Write a query to find the minimum number of platforms required at each station to handle all train traffic to ensure that no two trains overlap at any station.

Table: train_schedule 
+---------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE|
+---------------+----------+
| station_id    | int      |
| train_id      | int      |
| arrival_time  | time     |
| departure_time| time     |
+-------------+------------+

My Solution:-
WITH events AS (
    SELECT station_id, arrival_time AS event_time, 1 AS event_type
    FROM train_schedule
    UNION ALL
    SELECT station_id, departure_time AS event_time, -1 AS event_type
    FROM train_schedule
),
event_counts AS (
    SELECT station_id, event_time, event_type,
           SUM(event_type) OVER (PARTITION BY station_id ORDER BY event_time) AS platforms_needed
    FROM events
)
SELECT station_id, MAX(platforms_needed) AS min_platforms_required
FROM event_counts
GROUP BY station_id;

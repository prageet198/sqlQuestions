Question:-
You are a DevOps engineer responsible for monitoring the health and status of various services in your organization's infrastructure. 
Your team conducts canary tests on each service every minute to ensure their reliability and performance. As part of your responsibilities, 
you need to develop a SQL to identify any service that experiences continuous downtime for at least 5 minutes so that team can find the root cause and 
fix the issue. Display the output in descending order of service down minutes.

Table:service_status 
+--------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE   |
+--------------+-------------+
| service_name | varchar(4) |
| status       | varchar(4)  |
| updated_time | datetime    |
+--------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
SELECT service_name, updated_time, status,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY service_name ORDER BY updated_time) AS overallRank,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY service_name, status ORDER BY updated_time) AS serviceRanked
FROM service_status
)
SELECT service_name, MIN(updated_time) AS downTimeStart, MAX(updated_time) AS downTimeEnd, COUNT(*) AS totalDowntime
FROM initialData WHERE status='down'
GROUP BY service_name, (overallRank-serviceRanked)
HAVING COUNT(*)>=5
ORDER BY totalDowntime DESC

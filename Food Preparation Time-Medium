Question:-
You're analyzing the efficiency of food delivery on Zomato, focusing on the time taken by restaurants to prepare orders. Total food delivery time for an order 
is a combination of food preparation time + time taken by rider to deliver the order. 
Write an SQL to calculate average food preparation time(in minutes) for each restaurant . Round the average to 2 decimal points and sort the 
output in increasing order of average time.

Table: orders
+------------------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME            | DATA_TYPE |
+------------------------+-----------+
| order_id               | int       |
| restaurant_id          | int       |
| order_time             | time      |
| expected_delivery_time | time      |
| actual_delivery_time   | time      |
| rider_delivery_mins    | int       |
+------------------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
  select restaurant_id, rider_delivery_mins,
  TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, order_time,actual_delivery_time) AS totalDeliveryTime
  from orders
  )
  
  SELECT restaurant_id,
  ROUND(AVG((totalDeliveryTime-rider_delivery_mins)),2) AS avgFoodPrepTime
  FROM initialData
  GROUP BY restaurant_id
  ORDER BY avgFoodPrepTime

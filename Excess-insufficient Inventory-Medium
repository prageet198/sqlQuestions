DIFFICULTY:-MEDIUM
COMPANY:-Flipkart

Question:-
Suppose you are a data analyst working for Flipkart. Your task is to identify excess and insufficient inventory at various Flipkart warehouses in terms of no of units and cost. 
Excess inventory is when inventory levels are greater than inventory targets else its insufficient inventory.

Write an SQL to derive excess/insufficient Inventory volume and value in cost for each location as well as at overall company level, display the results in ascending 
order of location id.

Table: inventory
+------------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME      | DATA_TYPE |
+------------------+-----------+
| inventory_level  | int       |
| inventory_target | int       |
| location_id      | int       |
| product_id       | int       |
+------------------+-----------+
Table: products
+-------------+--------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE    |
+-------------+--------------+
| product_id  | int          |
| unit_cost   | decimal(5,2) |
+-------------+--------------+

My Solution:-
WITH calculation AS (
select inventory.location_id,
SUM((inventory.inventory_level-inventory.inventory_target)) AS excessInsufficientQty,
SUM((inventory.inventory_level-inventory.inventory_target) * products.unit_cost) AS excessInsufficientValue
from inventory INNER JOIN products
ON inventory.product_id=products.product_id
GROUP BY inventory.location_id
  ),
  combinedAll AS (
  SELECT 'Overall' AS location_id,
  SUM(excessInsufficientQty) AS excessInsufficientQty,
  SUM(excessInsufficientValue) AS excessInsufficientValue 
  FROM calculation
    )
    
    SELECT CAST(location_id as CHAR) as location_id,
    excessInsufficientQty,
    excessInsufficientValue
    FROM calculation
    UNION ALL
    SELECT location_id,
    excessInsufficientQty,
    excessInsufficientValue
    FROM combinedAll

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (
select i.location_id as location_id
,sum(inventory_level-inventory_target) as excess_insufficient_qty
,sum((inventory_level-inventory_target)*p.unit_cost) as excess_insufficient_value 
from inventory i 
inner join products p on i.product_id=p.product_id
group by i.location_id)

select CAST(location_id as CHAR) as location_id , excess_insufficient_qty,excess_insufficient_value
from cte
union all
select 'Overall' as location_id 
, sum(excess_insufficient_qty) as excess_insufficient_qty
, sum(excess_insufficient_value) as excess_insufficient_value
from cte
ORDER BY location_id;

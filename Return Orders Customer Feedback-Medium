Question:-
Namastekart, an e-commerce company, has observed a notable surge in return orders recently. They suspect that a specific group of customers may be responsible 
for a significant portion of these returns. To address this issue, their initial goal is to identify customers who have returned more than 50% of their orders. 
This way, they can proactively reach out to these customers to gather feedback.
Write an SQL to find list of customers along with their return percent (Round to 2 decimal places), display the output in ascending order of customer name.

Table: orders (primary key : order_id)
+---------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE   |
+---------------+-------------+
| customer_name | varchar(10) |
| order_date    | date        |
| order_id      | int         |
| sales         | int         |
+---------------+-------------+

Table: returns (primary key : order_id)
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| order_id    | int       |
| return_date | date      |
+-------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH orderData AS (
  SELECT customer_name,
  COUNT(*) AS totalOrders
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_name),
  
returnData AS(
select orders.order_id,
orders.customer_name,
CASE WHEN returns.return_date IS NOT NULL THEN '1'
ELSE '0' END AS returnStatus
from orders LEFT JOIN returns
ON orders.order_id=returns.order_id ),

returnTotal AS (
  SELECT customer_name,
  COUNT(*) AS totalReturn
  FROM returnData 
  WHERE returnStatus='1'
  GROUP BY customer_name),

overAllData AS(
SELECT returnTotal.customer_name,
orderData.totalOrders,
returnTotal.totalReturn,
ROUND((returnTotal.totalReturn/orderData.totalOrders)*100,2) AS returnPerct
FROM returnTotal INNER JOIN orderData
ON returnTotal.customer_name=orderData.customer_name
HAVING ROUND((returnTotal.totalReturn/orderData.totalOrders)*100,2)>=50)

SELECT customer_name, returnPerct FROM overAllData
ORDER BY customer_name

Actual Solution:-
select customer_name,  round(count(r.order_id)*100.0/count(*),2)  as return_percent
from orders o
left join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
group by customer_name
having  count(r.order_id) > count(*)*0.5
order by customer_name;

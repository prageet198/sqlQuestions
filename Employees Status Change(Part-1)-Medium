Question:-
You work in the Human Resources (HR) department of a growing company that tracks the status of its employees year over year. The company needs to analyze 
employee status changes between two consecutive years: 2020 and 2021.

The company's HR system has two separate tables of employees for the years 2020 and 2021, which include each employee's unique identifier (emp_id) 
and their corresponding designation (role) within the organization.

The task is to track how the designations of employees have changed over the year. Specifically, you are required to identify the following changes:

Promoted: If an employee's designation has changed (e.g., from Trainee to Developer, or from Developer to Manager).
Resigned: If an employee was present in 2020 but has left the company by 2021.
New Hire: If an employee was hired in 2021 but was not present in 2020.

Assume that employees can only be promoted and cannot be demoted.


Table: emp_2020 
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| emp_id      | int      |
| designation | date     |
+-------------+----------+

Table: emp_2021
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| emp_id      | int      |
| designation | date     |
+-------------+----------+

My Solution:-
WITH combineData AS(
select emp_2020.emp_id AS emp2020id,
emp_2020.designation  AS emp2020dest,
emp_2021.emp_id AS emp2021id,
emp_2021.designation  AS emp2021dest,
CASE WHEN emp_2020.designation!=emp_2021.designation THEN 'Promoted'
	WHEN emp_2021.emp_id IS NULL THEN 'Resigned'
    WHEN emp_2020.emp_id IS NULL THEN 'New Hire'
    ELSE 'N/A' END AS status
from emp_2021 FULL JOIN  emp_2020 ON emp_2021.emp_id=emp_2020.emp_id
  )
  SELECT CASE WHEN emp2020id IS NULL THEN emp2021id
  			WHEN emp2021id IS NULL THEN emp2020id
            ELSE emp2020id END AS finalEmpId,
            status
      FROM combineData WHERE status!='N/A'
      ORDER BY finalEmpId

Actual Solution:-
SELECT 
    COALESCE(e20.emp_id, e21.emp_id) AS emp_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN e20.designation != e21.designation THEN 'Promoted'
        WHEN e21.designation IS NULL THEN 'Resigned'
        ELSE 'New Hire'
    END AS comment
FROM emp_2020 e20
LEFT JOIN emp_2021 e21 ON e20.emp_id = e21.emp_id
WHERE e20.designation != e21.designation 
   OR e20.designation IS NULL 
   OR e21.designation IS NULL

UNION 

SELECT 
    COALESCE(e20.emp_id, e21.emp_id) AS emp_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN e20.designation != e21.designation THEN 'Promoted'
        WHEN e21.designation IS NULL THEN 'Resigned'
        ELSE 'New Hire'
    END AS comment
FROM emp_2021 e21
LEFT JOIN emp_2020 e20 ON e20.emp_id = e21.emp_id
WHERE e20.designation != e21.designation 
   OR e20.designation IS NULL 
   OR e21.designation IS NULL;

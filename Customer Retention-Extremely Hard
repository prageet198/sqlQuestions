Question:-
Customer retention can be defined as number of customers who continue to make purchases over a certain period compared to the total number of customers. 
Here's a step-by-step approach to calculate customer retention rate:

1- Determine the number of customers who made purchases 
in the current period (e.g., month: m )
2- Identify the number of customers from month m who made purchases 
in month m+1 , m+2 as well.
Suppose you are a data analyst working for Amazon. The company is interested in measuring customer retention over the months to understand 
how many customers continue to make purchases over time. Your task is to write an SQL to derive customer retention month over month, display 
the output in ascending order of current year, month & future year, month.

Table: orders
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| order_id    | int       |
| customer_id | int       |
| order_date  | date      |
+-------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH yearlyMonthly AS(
SELECT customer_id,YEAR(order_date) AS orderYear,MONTH(order_date) AS orderMonth
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id,YEAR(order_date),MONTH(order_date)
),
retentionData AS(
SELECT m1.customer_id, m1.orderYear AS currentYear,
m1.orderMonth AS currentMonth, m2.orderYear AS futureYear, m2.orderMonth AS futureMonth
FROM yearlyMonthly AS m1 INNER JOIN yearlyMonthly AS m2
ON m1.customer_id=m2.customer_id AND ((m2.orderYear=m1.orderYear AND m2.orderMonth>m1.orderMonth) OR (m2.orderYear>m1.orderYear))
),
totalRetentionCustomers AS(
  SELECT currentYear, currentMonth, futureYear,futureMonth, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS totalretained
 FROM retentionData
  GROUP BY currentYear, currentMonth, futureYear,futureMonth
),
totalCustomers AS (
  SELECT orderYear AS currrentYears, orderMonth AS currentMonths,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS totalCustomers
  FROM yearlyMonthly
  GROUP BY orderYear, orderMonth
)
SELECT currentYear, currentMonth, futureYear,futureMonth, totalCustomers, totalretained
FROM totalRetentionCustomers INNER JOIN totalCustomers
ON totalRetentionCustomers.currentYear=totalCustomers.currrentYears AND totalRetentionCustomers.currentMonth=totalCustomers.currentMonths
ORDER BY currentYear, currentMonth, futureYear,futureMonth

Actual Solution:-
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        YEAR(order_date) AS year, 
        MONTH(order_date) AS month, 
        customer_id 
    FROM orders
)
SELECT 
    cm.year AS current_year,
    cm.month AS current_month,
    fm.year AS future_year,
    fm.month AS future_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cm.customer_id) AS total_customers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN fm.customer_id = cm.customer_id THEN fm.customer_id END) AS retained_customers
FROM cte cm
INNER JOIN cte fm 
    ON (fm.year > cm.year OR (fm.year = cm.year AND fm.month > cm.month))
GROUP BY cm.year, cm.month, fm.year, fm.month
ORDER BY cm.year, cm.month, fm.year, fm.month;

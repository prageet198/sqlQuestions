Question:-
You have a table named ott_viewership. Write an SQL query to find the top 2 most-watched shows in each genre in the United States. Return the show name, genre, 
and total duration watched for each of the top 2 most-watched shows in each genre. sort the result by genre and total duration.

Tables: ott_viewership
+--------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE   |
+--------------+-------------+
| viewer_id    | int         |
| show_id      | int         |
| show_name    | varchar(20) |
| genre        | varchar(10) |
| country      | varchar(15) |
| view_date    | date        |
| duration_min | int         |
+--------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH combineData AS(
select show_name, genre, SUM(duration_min) AS totalWatched
from ott_viewership
WHERE country='United States' 
GROUP BY show_name, genre
  ),
  calculation AS(
  SELECT *,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY genre ORDER BY totalWatched DESC) AS ranked
  FROM combineData
    )
    
    SELECT show_name, genre, totalWatched
    FROM calculation
    WHERE ranked IN ('1','2')
    ORDER BY genre,totalWatched

Actual Solution:-
WITH RankedShows AS (
    SELECT show_name, genre, SUM(duration_min) AS total_duration,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY genre ORDER BY SUM(duration_min) DESC) AS rn
    FROM ott_viewership
    WHERE country = 'United States'
    GROUP BY show_name, genre
)
SELECT show_name, genre, total_duration
FROM RankedShows
WHERE rn <= 2
ORDER BY genre,total_duration;

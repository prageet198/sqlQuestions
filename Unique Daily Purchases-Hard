Question:-
Suppose you are analyzing the purchase history of customers in an e-commerce platform. Your task is to identify customers who have bought different products on different dates.
Write an SQL to find customers who have bought different products on different dates, means product purchased on a given day is not repeated on any other day by the customer. 
Also note that for the customer to qualify he should have made purchases on at least 2 distinct dates. Please note that customer can purchase same product more 
than once on the same day and that doesn't disqualify him. Output should contain customer id and number of products bought by the customer in ascending order of userid.

Table: purchase_history 
+--------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE |
+--------------+-----------+
| userid       | int       |
| productid    | int       |
| purchasedate | date      |
+--------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
  SELECT userid,productid,purchasedate
  FROM purchase_history
  GROUP BY userid,productid,purchasedate
 ),
 combineData AS(
 SELECT userid, COUNT(DISTINCT purchasedate) AS distDate,
 COUNT(productid) AS totalProduct, COUNT(DISTINCT productid) AS totalUniqueProducts
 FROM initialData
 GROUP BY userid
 )
 SELECT userid, totalProduct
 FROM combineData
 WHERE distDate>1 AND totalProduct=totalUniqueProducts
 ORDER BY userid

Question:-
You are given the data of employees along with their salary and department. Write an SQL to find list of employees who have salary greater than average employee 
salary of the company.  However, while calculating the company average salary to compare with an employee salary do not consider salaries of that employee's department, 
display the output in ascending order of employee ids.

Table: employee
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| emp_id      | int         |
| salary      | int         |
| department  | varchar(15) |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH overallAvgSal AS (
  SELECT AVG(salary) AS compAvgSala 
  FROM employee
),
deptAvgSal AS (
  SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS deptAvgSal
  FROM employee
  GROUP BY department
)
SELECT department, 
       CASE 
           WHEN compAvgSala > deptAvgSal THEN compAvgSala - deptAvgSal 
           ELSE deptAvgSal - compAvgSala 
       END AS leftAvg
FROM deptAvgSal 
CROSS JOIN overallAvgSal;

Actual Solution:-
select * from 
employee e1
where salary > (select avg(e2.salary) 
from employee e2 
where e1.department != e2.department
)
ORDER BY emp_id ;

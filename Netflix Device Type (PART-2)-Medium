Question:-
In the Netflix viewing history dataset, you are tasked with identifying viewers who have a consistent viewing pattern across multiple devices. Specifically, 
viewers who have watched the same title on more than 1 device type. 
Write an SQL query to find users who have watched more number of titles on multiple devices than the number of titles they watched on single device. 
Output the user id , no of titles watched on multiple devices and no of titles watched on single device, display the output in ascending order of user_id.

Table:viewing_history
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| user_id     | int         |
| title       | varchar(20) |
| device_type | varchar(10) |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH overAllData AS(
SELECT user_id, title, COUNT(device_type) AS totalDeviceType
FROM viewing_history
GROUP BY user_id,title
 ),
 cal AS(
 SELECT user_id,
 SUM(CASE WHEN totalDeviceType>1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS multipleDeviceCount,
 SUM(CASE WHEN totalDeviceType=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS singleDeviceCount
 FROM overAllData
 GROUP BY user_id
   )
   
   SELECT * FROM cal
   WHERE multipleDeviceCount>singleDeviceCount
   ORDER BY user_id

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (
select user_id,title,count(device_type) as cnt_device_type
from viewing_history 
group by user_id,title
)
, cte2 as (
select user_id
,sum(case when cnt_device_type>1 then 1 else 0 end) as multiple_device_cnt
,sum(case when cnt_device_type=1 then 1 else 0 end) as single_device_cnt
from cte 
group by user_id
)
select * 
from cte2
where multiple_device_cnt>single_device_cnt
ORDER BY user_id ;

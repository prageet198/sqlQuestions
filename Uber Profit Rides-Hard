DIFFICULTY:-Hard
COMPANY:-Uber

Question:-
A profit ride for a Uber driver is considered when the start location and start time of a ride exactly match with the previous ride's end location and end time. 
Write an SQL to calculate total number of rides and total profit rides by each driver, display the output in ascending order of id.

Table: drivers
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| id          | varchar(10) |
| start_loc   | varchar(1)  |
| start_time  | time        |
| end_loc     | varchar(1)  |
| end_time    | time        |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH allData AS(
SELECT *,
LAG(end_time,1,0) OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY start_time) AS previousEndTime,
LAG(end_loc,1,0) OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY start_time) AS previousLocation
FROM drivers
)

SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS totalRides,
SUM(CASE WHEN start_time=previousEndTime AND start_loc=previousLocation THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS profitRides
FROM allData
GROUP BY id

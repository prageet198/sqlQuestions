Question:-
You're working for a financial analytics company that specializes in analyzing credit card expenditures. You have a dataset containing information about users' credit 
card expenditures across different card companies.
Write an SQL query to find the total expenditure from other cards (excluding Mastercard) for users who hold Mastercard.  
Display only the users(along with Mastercard expense and other expense) for which expense from other cards together is more than Mastercard expense.

Table: expenditures
+--------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE   |
+--------------+-------------+
| user_name    | varchar(10) |
| expenditure  | int         |
| card_company | varchar(15) |
+--------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH masterCard AS(
SELECT user_name, SUM(expenditure) AS masterCardExpense
from expenditures
WHERE card_company='Mastercard'
GROUP BY user_name
),
otherExpenses AS(
SELECT user_name, SUM(expenditure) AS otherExpense
from expenditures
WHERE card_company!='Mastercard'
GROUP BY user_name
)
SELECT masterCard.user_name, masterCardExpense,otherExpense
FROM masterCard INNER JOIN otherExpenses ON masterCard.user_name=otherExpenses.user_name
WHERE otherExpense>masterCardExpense

Actual Solution:-
with mastercard as (
select user_name,sum(expenditure) as expenditure
from expenditures 
where card_company='Mastercard'
group by user_name
)
, non_mastercard as (
select user_name,sum(expenditure) as expenditure
from expenditures 
where card_company!='Mastercard'
group by user_name
)
select m.user_name, m.expenditure as mastercard_expense,nm.expenditure as other_expense
from mastercard m 
inner join non_mastercard nm on m.user_name=nm.user_name
where nm.expenditure > m.expenditure;

Question:-
In a quick commerce business, Analyzing the frequency and timing of purchases can help the company identify engaged customers and tailor promotions accordingly.
You are tasked to identify customers who have made a minimum of three purchases, ensuring that each purchase occurred in a different month. 
This information will assist in targeting marketing efforts towards customers who show consistent buying behavior over time.
Write an SQL to display customer id and no of orders placed by them.

Table: orders 
+---------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE |
+---------------+-----------+
| customer_id   | int       |
| order_id      | int       |
| order_date    | date      |
+---------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH customerData AS (
select customer_id, order_id, order_date, MONTH(order_date) AS orderedMonth
from orders
  )
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS totalOrders
  FROM customerData
  GROUP BY customer_id
  HAVING COUNT(*)>=3 AND COUNT(DISTINCT orderedMonth)>=3

Actual Solution:-
SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
     FROM 
        orders
     GROUP BY 
        customer_id
     HAVING 
        COUNT(order_id) >= 3
        AND COUNT(order_id) = COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m'))

Question:-
You have a table named covid_tests with the following columns: name, id, age, and corad score. The corad score values are categorized as follows:

-1 indicates a negative result.
Scores from 2 to 5 indicate a mild condition.
Scores from 6 to 10 indicate a serious condition.
Write a query to produce an output with the following columns:
age_group: Groups of ages (18-30, 31-45, 46-60).
count_negative: The number of people with a negative result in each age group.
count_mild: The number of people with a mild condition in each age group.
count_serious: The number of people with a serious condition in each age group.

Table: covid_tests
+---------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE   |
+---------------+-------------+
| name          | varchar(10) |
| id            | int         |
| age           | int         |
| corad_score   | int         |

My Solution:-
WITH AgeGroups AS (
    SELECT
        CASE 
            WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 30 THEN '18-30'
            WHEN age BETWEEN 31 AND 45 THEN '31-45'
            WHEN age BETWEEN 46 AND 60 THEN '46-60'
        END AS age_group,
        corad_score
    FROM covid_tests
    WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 60
)
SELECT
    age_group,
    SUM(CASE WHEN corad_score = -1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_negative,
    SUM(CASE WHEN corad_score BETWEEN 2 AND 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_mild,
    SUM(CASE WHEN corad_score BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_serious
FROM AgeGroups
WHERE age_group IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY age_group;

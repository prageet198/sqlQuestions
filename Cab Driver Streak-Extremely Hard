Question:-
A Cab booking company has a dataset of its trip ratings, each row represents a single trip of a driver. A trip has a positive rating if it was rated 4 or above, 
a streak of positive ratings is when a driver has a rating of 4 and above in consecutive trips. example: If there are 3 consecutive trips with a rating of 4 or 
above then the streak is 2.
Find out the maximum streak that a driver has had and sort the output in descending order of their maximum streak and then by descending order of driver_id.
Note: only users who have at least 1 streak should be included in the output.
 

Table: rating_table 
+-----------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME     | DATA_TYPE|
+-----------------+----------+
| trip_time       | datetime |    
| driver_id       | varchar  |
| trip_id         | int      |
| rating          | int      |
+-----------------+----------+

My Solution:-
WITH RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        driver_id, 
        trip_id,
        trip_time,
        rating,
        trip_id - 
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY driver_id ORDER BY trip_time) AS streak_group
    FROM rating_table
    WHERE rating>=4
),
StreakLengths AS (
    SELECT 
        driver_id, 
        streak_group,
        COUNT(*) - 1 AS streak_length
    FROM RankedRatings
    GROUP BY driver_id, streak_group
),
MaxStreaks AS (
    SELECT 
        driver_id, 
        MAX(streak_length) AS max_streak
    FROM StreakLengths
    GROUP BY driver_id
)
SELECT 
    driver_id, 
    max_streak
FROM MaxStreaks
WHERE max_streak > 0
ORDER BY max_streak DESC, driver_id DESC;

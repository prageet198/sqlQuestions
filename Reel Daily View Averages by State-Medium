Question:-
Meta (formerly Facebook) is analyzing the performance of Instagram Reels across different states in the USA. You have access to a table named REEL 
that tracks the cumulative views of each reel over time. Write an SQL to get average daily views for each Instagram Reel in each state. 
Round the average to 2 decimal places and sort the result by average is descending order. 

Table: reel 
+-----------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME     | DATA_TYPE|
+-----------------+----------+
| reel_id         | int      |    
| record_date     | date     |
| state           | varchar  |
| cumulative_views| int      |
+-------------+--------------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
select reel_id, state,
cumulative_views,
LAG(cumulative_views,1,0) OVER(PARTITION BY state ORDER BY record_date) AS previousView
from reel 
  ),
  calculation AS (
 SELECT reel_id, state, (cumulative_views-previousView) AS dailyViews
 FROM initialData
    )
    SELECT reel_id, state, ROUND(AVG(dailyViews),2) AS avgDailyViews
    FROM calculation
    GROUP BY reel_id, state
    ORDER BY avgDailyViews DESC

Actual Solution:-
WITH MaxViews AS (
    SELECT
        Reel_id,
        State,
        MAX(Cumulative_Views) AS Max_Cumulative_Views,
        COUNT(*) AS Days
    FROM REEL
    GROUP BY Reel_id, State
)
SELECT
    Reel_id,
    State,
    ROUND(Max_Cumulative_Views / Days, 2) AS Avg_Daily_Views
FROM MaxViews
order by Avg_Daily_Views desc;

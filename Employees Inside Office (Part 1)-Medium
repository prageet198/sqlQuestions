Question:-
A company record its employee's movement In and Out of office in a table. Please note below points about the data:
1- First entry for each employee is “in”
2- Every “in” is succeeded by an “out”
3- Employee can work across days
Write a SQL to find the number of employees inside the Office at “2019-04-01 19:05:00".
Table: employee_record
+-------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE  |
+-------------+------------+
| emp_id      | int        |
| action      | varchar(3) |
| created_at  | datetime   |
+-------------+------------+

My Solution:-
with reords as (
select *
, lead(created_at) over(partition by emp_id order by created_at) as lefted
 from employee_record )
 SELECT COUNT(*) AS noOfEmpInside
 FROM reords
 WHERE action='in' AND '2019-04-01 19:05:00' BETWEEN created_at AND lefted

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (
select *
, lead(created_at) over(partition by emp_id order by created_at) as next_created_at
 from employee_record )
 select count(*) as no_of_emp_inside
 from cte
 where action='in'
 and '2019-04-01 19:05:00' between created_at and next_created_at;

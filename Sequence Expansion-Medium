Question:-
You have a table named numbers containing a single column n. You are required to generate an output that expands each number n into a sequence where the number appears n times.


Table: numbers 
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| n           |   int     |    
+-------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH RECURSIVE NumberSeries AS (
    SELECT
        n AS original_number,
        n AS expanded_number,
        1 AS sequence_length
    FROM numbers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        ns.original_number,
        ns.expanded_number,
        ns.sequence_length + 1
    FROM NumberSeries ns
    WHERE ns.sequence_length < ns.original_number
)
SELECT expanded_number
FROM NumberSeries
ORDER BY original_number, sequence_length;

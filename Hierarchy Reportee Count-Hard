Question:-
Write a SQL query to find the number of reportees (both direct and indirect) under each manager. The output should include:
m_id: The manager ID.
num_of_reportees: The total number of unique reportees (both direct and indirect) under that manager.

Order the result by number of reportees in descending order.

Table: hierarchy
+-------------+------------+
|COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE  |
+-------------+------------+
| e_id        | int        |
| m_id        | int        |
+-------------+------------+

My Solution:-
WITH RECURSIVE managerCte AS(
  SELECT m_id AS managerId, e_id AS empId
  FROM hierarchy
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT h.m_id AS managerId, m.empId
  FROM hierarchy h JOIN managerCte m ON h.e_id=m.managerId
 )
 SELECT managerId, COUNT(DISTINCT empId) AS noOfReportees
 FROM managerCte
 GROUP BY managerId
 ORDER BY noOfReportees DESC

Question:-
You are given table of cricket match played in a ICC cricket tournament with the details of winner for each match. You need to derive a points table using below rules.
1- For each win a team gets 2 points. 
2- For a loss team gets 0 points.
3- In case of a draw both the team gets 1 point each.
Display team name , matches played, # of wins , # of losses and points.  Sort output in ascending order of team name.

Table: icc_world_cup 
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| team_1      | varchar(10) |
| team_2      | varchar(10) |
| winner      | varchar(10) |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH teamDetail AS(
SELECT team_1 AS teamName,
CASE WHEN team_1=winner THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS winFlag,
CASE WHEN winner='Draw' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS drawFlag
FROM icc_world_cup
UNION ALL
SELECT team_2 AS teamName,
CASE WHEN team_2=winner THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS winFlag,
CASE WHEN winner='Draw' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS drawFlag
FROM icc_world_cup
)
SELECT teamName, COUNT(*) AS totalMatch,
SUM(winFlag) AS noOfWins, 
COUNT(*)-SUM(winFlag)-SUM(drawFlag) AS noOfLoss,
2*SUM(winFlag)+SUM(drawFlag) AS totalPoints
FROM teamDetail
GROUP BY teamName ORDER BY teamName

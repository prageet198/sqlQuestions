Question:-
Suppose you are a data analyst working for Spotify (a music streaming service company) . Your company is interested in analyzing user engagement with playlists 
and wants to identify the most popular tracks among all the playlists.
Write an SQL query to find the top 2 most popular tracks based on number of playlists they are part of. 
Your query should return the top 2 track ID along with total number of playlist they are part of , sorted by the same and  track id in descending order , 
Please consider only those playlists which were played by at least 2 distinct users.

Table: playlists
+---------------+--------------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE    |
+---------------+--------------+
| playlist_id   | int          |
| playlist_name | varchar(15) |
+---------------+--------------+
Table: playlist_tracks
+-------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE |
+-------------+-----------+
| playlist_id | int       |
| track_id    | int       |
+-------------+-----------+
Table: playlist_plays
+-------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE  |
+-------------+------------+
| playlist_id | int        |
| user_id     | varchar(2) |
+-------------+------------+

My Solution:-
WITH uniqueUsers AS(
SELECT playlist_id, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS uniqueUsers
FROM playlist_plays
GROUP BY playlist_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)>=2
  )
SELECT TOP 2 track_id, COUNT(playlist_tracks.playlist_id) AS noOfPlaylist
FROM playlist_tracks INNER JOIN uniqueUsers
ON playlist_tracks.playlist_id=uniqueUsers.playlist_id
GROUP BY track_id
ORDER BY noOfPlaylist DESC

Actual Solution:-
SELECT pt.track_id, count(distinct p.playlist_id) as no_of_playlist
FROM playlists p
INNER JOIN playlist_tracks pt ON p.playlist_id = pt.playlist_id 
INNER JOIN (select playlist_id from playlist_plays
group by playlist_id
having count(distinct user_id)>1
) t on t.playlist_id = pt.playlist_id 
GROUP BY pt.track_id 
ORDER BY no_of_playlist desc,pt.track_id DESC
limit 2;

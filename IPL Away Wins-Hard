Question:-
In the Indian Premier League (IPL), each team plays two matches against every other team: one at their home venue and one at their opponent's venue. 
We want to identify team combinations where each team wins the away match but loses the home match against the same opponent. 
Write an SQL query to find such team combinations, where each team wins at the opponent's venue but loses at their own home venue.

Table: Matches
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| away_team   | varchar(10) |
| home_team   | varchar(10) |
| match_id    | int         |
| winner_team | varchar(10) |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
SELECT match_id, home_team, away_team, CASE WHEN winner_team=away_team THEN 1 ELSE 0 END isAwayFlag
from matches
)

SELECT n1.home_team,n1.away_team
FROM initialData AS n1 INNER JOIN initialData AS n2 ON  n1.home_team=n2.away_team AND n1.away_team=n2.home_team AND n1.isAwayFlag=1 AND n2.isAwayFLag=1 AND n1.match_id

Actual Solution:-
SELECT T1.home_team as team1,T1.away_team as team2
FROM Matches AS T1
JOIN Matches AS T2 ON T1.home_team = T2.away_team AND T1.away_team = T2.home_team
WHERE
 T1.match_id < T2.match_id  and  T1.winner_team = T1.away_team  AND T2.winner_team = T2.away_team;

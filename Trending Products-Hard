DIFFICULTY:-Hard
COMPANY:-Amazon

Question:-
Amazon wants to find out the trending products for each month. Trending products are those for which any given month sales are more 
than the sum of previous 2 months sales for that product.

Please note that for first 2 months of operations this metrics does not make sense. So output should start from 3rd month only.  
Assume that each product has at least 1 sale each month, display order month and product id. Sort by order month.

Table: orders 
+-------------+------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE  |
+-------------+------------+
| order_month | varchar(6) |
| product_id  | varchar(5) |
| sales       | int        |
+-------------+------------+

My Solution:-
WITH productData AS(
SELECT order_month, product_id, sales,SUBSTRING(order_month, 5, 2) AS month
FROM orders
),
combineData AS(
SELECT order_month,product_id, sales, month,
SUM(sales) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) AS previous2MonthSales,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY month) AS rn
FROM productData
)

SELECT order_month, product_id FROM combineData
WHERE rn>=3 AND sales> previous2MonthSales
ORDER BY order_month, product_id ASC;

Acutual Solution:-
with cte as (
select * 
,sum(sales) over(partition by product_id order by order_month rows between 2 preceding and 1 preceding) as last2
,row_number() over(partition by product_id order by order_month) as rn
from orders 
)
select order_month,product_id from cte 
where rn>=3 and sales > last2
ORDER BY order_month,product_id ASC;

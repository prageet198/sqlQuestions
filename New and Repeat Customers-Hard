DIFFICULTY:-Hard
COMPANY:-Flipkart

Question:-
Flipkart wants to build a very important business metrics where they want to track on daily basis how many new and repeat customers are purchasing products from their website. A new customer is defined when he purchased anything 
for the first time from the website and repeat customer is someone who has done at least one purchase in the past.

Display order date , new customers , repeat customers  in ascending order of repeat customers.

Table: customer_orders
+--------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE |
+--------------+-----------+
| order_id     | int       |
| customer_id  | int       |
| order_date   | date      |
| order_amount | int       |
+--------------+-----------+

My Solution:-
WITH customerFirstOrderDate AS (
  SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS firstOrderDate
  FROM customer_orders
  GROUP BY customer_id
  )
 SELECT customer_orders.order_date,
 SUM(CASE WHEN customer_orders.order_date=firstOrderDate THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS newCustomerFlag,
 SUM(CASE WHEN customer_orders.order_date>firstOrderDate THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS repeatCustomerFlag
 FROM customer_orders INNER JOIN customerFirstOrderDate ON customer_orders.customer_id=customerFirstOrderDate.customer_id
 GROUP BY customer_orders.order_date
 ORDER BY customer_orders.order_date

Question:-
Zomato is planning to offer a premium membership to customers who have placed multiple orders in a single day.
Your task is to write a SQL to find those customers who have placed multiple orders in a single day at least once , 
total order value generate by those customers and order value generated only by those orders, display the results in ascending order of total order value.

Table: orders (primary key : order_id)
+---------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE   |
+---------------+-------------+
| customer_name | varchar(20) |
| order_date    | datetime    |
| order_id      | int         |
| order_value   | int         |
+---------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH totalOrdersValue AS (
  SELECT customer_name, SUM(order_value) AS totalOrder
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_name
  ),
  dateWiseData AS(
  SELECT DATE(order_date) AS orderDate,
  customer_name,
  order_value
  FROM orders
    ),
    filterData AS(
   SELECT orderDate, customer_name, COUNT(*) AS totalOrders
   FROM dateWiseData
   GROUP BY orderDate,customer_name
   HAVING COUNT(*)>1
      ),
      
      dayWiseData AS(
    SELECT
    dateWiseData.customer_name,
    SUM(dateWiseData.order_value) AS dayOrderValue
    FROM filterData INNER JOIN dateWiseData
    ON filterData.orderDate=dateWiseData.orderDate AND filterData.customer_name=dateWiseData.customer_name
    GROUP BY dateWiseData.customer_name
        )
        
        SELECT totalOrdersValue.customer_name,
        totalOrdersValue.totalOrder,
        dayWiseData.dayOrderValue
        FROM totalOrdersValue INNER JOIN dayWiseData
        ON totalOrdersValue.customer_name=dayWiseData.customer_name
        ORDER BY totalOrdersValue.totalOrder

Actual Solution:-
with cte as (
select customer_name,CAST(order_date as DATE) as order_day
,count(*) as no_of_orders
 from orders 
group by customer_name,CAST(order_date as DATE) 
having count(*)>1
)
select orders.customer_name,sum(orders.order_value) as total_order_value
,sum(case when cte.customer_name is not null then orders.order_value end) as order_value
from orders
left join cte on orders.customer_name=cte.customer_name and 
CAST(orders.order_date as DATE) =cte.order_day
where orders.customer_name in (select distinct customer_name from cte)
group by orders.customer_name
ORDER BY total_order_value;

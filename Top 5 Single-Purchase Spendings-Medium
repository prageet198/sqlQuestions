Question:-
Write an SQL to retrieve the top 5 customers who have spent the most on their single purchase. Sort the result by max single purchase in descending order.

Table: purchase
+-------------+------------+
|COLUMN_NAME  | DATA_TYPE  |
+-------------+------------+
|customer_id  | int        |
|purchase_date| date       |
|amount       | int        |
+-------------+------------+

My Solution:-
WITH initialData AS(
select customer_id,
amount,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER By amount DESC) AS ranked
from purchase
  )
  SELECT customer_id, amount FROM initialData
  WHERE ranked=1
  ORDER BY amount DESC
  LIMIT 5

Actual Solution:-
SELECT customer_id, MAX(amount) AS max_amount
FROM purchase
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY max_amount DESC
LIMIT 5;

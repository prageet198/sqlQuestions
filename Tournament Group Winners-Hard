Question:-
You are given two tables, players and matches, with the following structure.

Each record in the table players represents a single player in the tournament. The column player_id contains the ID of each player. 
The column group_id contains the ID of the group each player belongs to.

Table: players 
+-----------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME     | DATA_TYPE|
+-----------------+----------+
| player_id       | int      |    
| group_id        | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
Each record in the table matches represents a single match in the group stage. The column first_player (second_player) contains the ID of the 
first player (second player) in each match. The column first_score (second_score) contains the number of points scored by the first player (second player) in each match. 
You may assume that, in each match, players belong to the same group.

Table: matches 
+---------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE|
+---------------+----------+
| match_id      | int      |    
| first_player  | int      |
| second_player | int      |
| first_score   | int      |
| second_score  | int      |
+---------------+----------+
Write an SQL to compute the winner in each group. The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total number of points within the group. 
If there is more than one such player, the winner is the one with the highest ID. Write an SQL query that returns a table containing the winner of each group. 
Each record should contain the ID of the group and the ID of the winner in this group. Records should be sorted by group id. 

My Solution:-
WITH playerData AS(
SELECT first_player AS playerId, first_score AS playerScore
FROM  matches 
UNION ALL
SELECT second_player, second_score
FROM matches
),
playerOverallScore AS(
SELECT playerId, SUM(playerScore) AS playerTotalScore
FROM playerData
GROUP BY playerId
),
playerGroupData AS(
SELECT group_id, playerOverallScore.playerId, playerTotalScore
FROM playerOverallScore INNER JOIN players ON playerOverallScore.playerId=players.player_id
),
ranking AS(
SELECT group_id, playerId, playerTotalScore, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY group_id ORDER BY playerTotalScore DESC, playerId DESC) AS ranked
FROM playerGroupData
)

SELECT group_id, playerId FROM ranking WHERE ranked='1'

Actual Solution:-
WITH PlayerPoints AS (
  select group_id,player_id,sum(points) as total_points
from (SELECT
        p.group_id,
        p.player_id,
        m.first_score AS points
    FROM players p
    inner JOIN matches m ON p.player_id = m.first_player 
  union all
   SELECT
        p.group_id,
        p.player_id,
        m.second_score AS points
    FROM players p
    inner JOIN matches m ON p.player_id = m.second_player) a
group by group_id,player_id
)
,RankedPlayers AS (
    SELECT
        group_id,
        player_id,
        total_points,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY group_id ORDER BY total_points DESC, player_id desc) AS rn
    FROM PlayerPoints
)
SELECT
    group_id,
    player_id AS winner_id
FROM RankedPlayers
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY group_id;

Question:-
You are given a history of credit card transaction data for the people of India across cities . Write an SQL to find how many days 
each city took to reach cumulative spend of 1500 from its first day of transactions. 

Display city, first transaction date , date of 1500 spend and # of days in the ascending order of city.

Table: credit_card_transactions
+------------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME      | DATA_TYPE   |
+------------------+-------------+
| transaction_id   | int         |
| transaction_date | date        |
| amount           | int         |
| card_type        | varchar(12) |
| city             | varchar(20) |
| gender           | varchar(1)  |
+------------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH overallData AS (
  SELECT 
    city, 
    transaction_date, 
    SUM(amount) AS totalAmt,
    MIN(transaction_date) OVER(PARTITION BY city) AS firstTrnsaction
  FROM credit_card_transactions
  GROUP BY city, transaction_date
),
rollingSum AS (
  SELECT *,
         SUM(totalAmt) OVER(PARTITION BY city ORDER BY transaction_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cummSum
  FROM overallData
)
SELECT city, firstTrnsaction, MIN(transaction_date) AS newDate,
MIN(transaction_date)- firstTrnsaction AS noOfDays
FROM rollingSum
WHERE cummSum>=1500
GROUP BY city, firstTrnsaction
ORDER BY city

Question:-
TCS wants to award employees based on number of projects completed by each individual each month.  Write an SQL to find best employee for each month along 
with number of projects completed by him/her in that month, display the output in descending order of number of completed projects.

Table: projects
+-------------------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME             | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------------------+-------------+
| project_id              | int         |
| employee_name           | varchar(10) |
| project_completion_date | date        |
+-------------------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH empDate AS (
  
select employee_name,
YEAR(project_completion_date) AS projectYear,
FORMAT(project_completion_date,'MM') AS projectMonth
from projects
),
calculationData AS(
SELECT employee_name, COUNT(*) AS totalProjects,
projectYear,projectMonth
FROM empDate
GROUP BY employee_name,projectYear,projectMonth),
rankingCalculation AS (
SELECT employee_name,
totalProjects,
projectYear,
projectMonth,
DENSE_RANK() OVER( PARTITION BY projectYear,projectMonth ORDER BY totalProjects DESC) AS ranked
FROM calculationData)

SELECT employee_name,
totalProjects,
CONCAT(projectYear,projectMonth) AS yearMonth
FROM rankingCalculation
WHERE ranked=1
ORDER BY totalProjects DESC

Actual Solution:-
with cte_projects_completed as (
select employee_name, DATE_FORMAT(project_completion_date,'%Y%m') as year_month_combo,count(project_completion_date) as no_of_completed_projects
from projects
where project_completion_date is not null
group by employee_name,DATE_FORMAT(project_completion_date,'%Y%m') )
select employee_name,no_of_completed_projects,year_month_combo as yearmonth from (
select employee_name,year_month_combo,no_of_completed_projects, rank() over(partition by year_month_combo order by no_of_completed_projects desc) as rn
from cte_projects_completed) a
where rn=1
ORDER BY no_of_completed_projects DESC;

Question:-
Suppose you are a manager of a data analytics company. You are tasked to build a new team consists of senior and junior data analysts. 
The total budget for the salaries is 70000.  You need to use the below criterion for hiring:

1- Keep hiring the seniors with the smallest salaries until you cannot hire anymore seniors.
2- Use the remaining budget to hire the juniors with the smallest salaries until you cannot hire anymore juniors.
Display employee id, experience and salary. Sort in decreasing order of salary.
Table: candidates
+-------------+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE   |
+-------------+-------------+
| emp_id      | int         |
| experience  | varchar(6) |
| salary      | int         |
+-------------+-------------+

My Solution:-
WITH overAllSal AS (
  SELECT *,
  SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS runningSalary
  FROM candidates
  ),
  seniorSal AS(
    SELECT * FROM overAllSal
    WHERE experience='Senior' AND runningSalary<=70000
    )
    SELECT  emp_id,experience,salary FROM seniorSal
    UNION ALL
    SELECT  emp_id,experience,salary FROM overAllSal
    WHERE experience='Junior' AND runningSalary<=70000-(SELECT SUM(salary) FROM seniorSal)
    ORDER BY salary DESC;
